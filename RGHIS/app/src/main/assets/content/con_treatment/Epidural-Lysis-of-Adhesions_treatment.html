            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Procedure</span></h2>
            <p><strong><em>How is the procedure performed?</em></strong></p>
            <p>You will be lying face down on your stomach for this procedure. Local anaesthetic will be administered to numb the skin over your buttock area. A small caliber, flexible catheter is then inserted through an opening at the tailbone (sacral hiatus) and directed under X-ray guidance to the affected nerve root.</p>
            <p><strong><em>What medications are used for this procedure?</em></strong></p>
            <p>Local anaesthetics, steroids or hyaluronidase or a combination of the three will be injected through the catheter to the affected nerve root. Steroids are effective in reducing the swelling and inflammation around the nerve roots. Hyaluronidase is a chemical enzyme that may help to reduce adhesions.</p>
            <p><strong><em>What should I do after the procedure?</em></strong></p>
            <p>Your doctor will teach you simple exercises to help maintain the movement of nerves in and out of the spinal canal. This type of exercise-induced nerve root movement is referred to as Neural Flossing. These exercises allow you to regain flexibility and strength and prevent the restriction of affected nerve roots and the resulting return of your pain.</p>
