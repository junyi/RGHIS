            <p>The treatment depends on the severity of the disease. An acute abscess is managed with a cut over the skin to release the pus. A chronic sinus usually will need to be excised or surgically opened.</p>
            <p>Complex or recurrent disease is treated by more extensive surgery. This may result in a large wound that requires moving different areas of skin to cover the defect. Larger wounds require longer healing times.</p>
