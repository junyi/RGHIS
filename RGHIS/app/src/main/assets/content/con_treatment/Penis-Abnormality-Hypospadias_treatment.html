            <p>A repair of the urine tube is required usually between one and two years of age. If done before two years of age, the boy will learn to stand up and pass urine in a normal way. <br>
            <br>
            In the operation, the tube is made to reach the tip of the penis, the curve is straightened out and the skin cover is refashioned. This is a complicated and meticulous operation. A urinary catheter (a soft drainage tube passed into the urinary bladder through the repaired urethra or urine tube) is needed to drain the urine for a period of time while healing occurs. <br>
            <br>
            The results depend on how severe the condition was before surgery. The main complications are fi stulas i.e. small areas of leakage which will need a second minor repair. For very severe cases, the repair may be done in stages. <br>

            Babies with hypospadias should not be circumcised as the foreskin is needed for use in later surgeries. </p>
