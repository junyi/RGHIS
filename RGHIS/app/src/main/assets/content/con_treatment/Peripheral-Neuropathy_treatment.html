            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>Your doctor will perform a thorough clinical evaluation to determine the part of the peripheral nervous system that is affected and the likely cause. The following investigations may be arranged: </p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
                <li><strong>Electromyography (EMG)<br>
                </strong>This is an important investigation that will help localise and characterise the nature and severity of the peripheral neuropathy. The first part of EMG involves stimulating the peripheral nerves and recording its electrical signals. The second part involves inserting a very fine needle into the limb or back muscles and recording motor activity. </li>
                <li><strong>Blood investigations</strong><br>
                To detect an underlying cause of the neuropathy, e.g. diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and vasculitis, various blood tests may be required. In certain types of hereditary neuropathy, blood samples may be sent for genetic tests. </li>
                <li><strong>Lumbar Puncture</strong><br>
                This is a bedside procedure to withdraw a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid from the lower back under local anaesthesia. The fluid will be sent for various tests. </li>
                <li><strong>Skin Biopsy</strong><br>
                This is a simple, bedside procedure to confirm neuropathy affecting small nerve endings in the skin. Punch skin biopsies (about 3mm in diameter) are performed under local anaesthesia on the leg and thigh. </li>
                <li><strong>Autonomic Function Test</strong><br>
                This is a non-invasive test that evaluates the autonomic nervous system. </li>
                <li><strong>Nerve Biopsy</strong><br>
                This is occasionally performed to confirm the presence of nerve inflammation, e.g. in vasculitic neuropathy. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Treatment</span></h2>
            <p>Treatment will depend on the underlying cause and type of neuropathy. For example, in diabetic neuropathy, treatment will be directed at achieving good blood sugar control to prevent further nerve damage. Symptomatic relief for neuropathic pain can usually be achieved by medications, such as amitriptyline and gabapentin.</p>
            <p>Immune-mediated neuropathies (such as GBS) are treated with either intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) or steroids. IVIG is pooled donor plasma which contains normal antibodies that can temporarily counteract the abnormal ones in the body. Steroids will help to suppress an abnormal immune response that attacks the nerve. </p>
            <p>Surgical decompression may benefit those with entrapment neuropathy, such as CTS.</p>
            <p><strong>Living with the Condition<br>
            </strong><br>
            In most patients, symptoms and functional impairment can be managed effectively and normal life expectancy is expected unless there is a co-existent systemic disease.<br>
            <br>
            One should adopt a healthy lifestyle so as to encourage nerve regeneration. Active and passive forms of exercise can improve muscle strength and prevent muscle wasting in paralysed limbs. </p>
            <p>Meticulous foot care is also important, especially in diabetic polyneuropathy. Mechanical aids can help to reduce pain and improve function. Hand or foot braces can compensate for muscle weakness or alleviate nerve compression.</p>
