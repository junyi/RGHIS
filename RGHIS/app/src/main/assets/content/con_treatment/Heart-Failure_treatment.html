            <p><strong>Heart failure</strong> is usually treated with lifestyle changes and medicines. Dietary changes to maintain proper weight and reduction of salt intake may be needed. Reducing salt intake helps to lessen swelling in the legs, feet and abdomen. Appropriate exercise such as walking, cycling, swimming, or low-impact aerobic exercises may be recommended, but it is important that heart failure patients begin an exercise programme with the advice of their doctors. The National Heart Centre Singapore offers good Cardiovascular Rehabilitation and Preventive Cardiology Programme for patients identified to have multiple risk factors for heart disease or who have just undergone <strong>open-heart surgery</strong>. </p>
            <p>Other lifestyle changes that may reduce the symptoms of heart failure include stopping smoking or other tobacco use, eliminating or reducing alcohol consumption and not using harmful drugs.</p>
            <p>One or more of the following types of medicines may be prescribed for heart failure:<br>
            - diuretics<br>
            - diagoxin<br>
            - vasodilators<br>
            - beta blockers<br>
            - angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors)<br>
            - angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)<br>
            - calcium channel blockers</p>
            <p>Diuretics eliminate excess salt and water through the kidneys by making patients urinate more often. This helps reduce the swelling caused by fluid build-up in the tissues. Digoxin helps the heart muscles have a stronger pumping action. Vasodilators, ACE inhibitors, ARBs and calcium channel blockers lower blood pressure and expand the blood vessels making it easier for the heart to pump blood through the vessels.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, surgery is needed to correct abnormalities of the heart or heart valves that cause heart failure. </p>
            <p>Congenital heart defects and abnormal heart valves can be repaired with surgery. Blocked coronary arteries can usually be treated with  or .</p>
            <p>With severe heart failure, the heart muscle may become so damaged that available treatments do not help. Patients with end-stage heart failure are usually considered for  and heart transplantation when all other treatments do not work. </p>
