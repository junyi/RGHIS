            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Treatment</span></h2>
            <p>A careful examination by a doctor may identify a definite cause for the itching. Your doctor can then recommend a specific treatment to eliminate problem. Treatment of pruritus ani may include these four points. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>1.  AVOID FURTHER TRAUMA</strong> to the affected area:<br>
            <br>
            Do not use any soap on the anal area.<br>
            <br>
            Do not rub the anal area with anything - not even toilet paper.   <br>
            <br>
            For hygiene, use wet toilet paper, wet tissues or a wet cloth to dab the area clean. Never rub.<br>
            <br>
            Do not to scratch the itchy area. Scratching causes more damage, which results in making the itching worse.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>2.  AVOID MOISTURE</strong> in the anal area: <br>
            <br>
            After cleaning, put some cotton or gauze to keep the area dry. <br>
            <br>
            Do not put any all medicated, perfumed and deodorant powders. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>3.  USE ONLY MEDICATIONS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR DOCTOR</strong> and use them only as directed. Lightly apply the prescribed medications and do not rub. <br>
                <br>
            <strong>4.  AVOID FOOD AND EXCESS LIQUIDS THAT MAKE YOU HAVE LOOSE OR FREQUENT STOOLS.</strong><br>
               <br>
            <strong><em>How long does this treatment usually take? <br>
            </em></strong><br>
            Most people experience some relief from itching within a week. Complete cure usually comes within four to six weeks.</p>
