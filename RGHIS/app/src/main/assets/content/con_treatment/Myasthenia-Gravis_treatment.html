            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <br>
            Your doctor will take a detailed medical history from you and do a thorough neurological examination. There is no single investigation that can absolutely exclude MG.<br>
            <br>
            Some investigations for MG include:<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Blood test</strong> <br>
            This is the simplest and most specific investigation but is only 90% sensitive. it detects the antibodies produced against the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. It takes about few weeks for the result to be available.  <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Repetitive Nerve Stimulation<br>
            </strong>This test is easy to perform but no very sensitive. It is an electrical test which involves giving small but tolerable electric shocks to nerves in the face, neck and forearm in quick secessions and recording the nerve responses. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Singer Fiber Electromyography (SFEMG)<br>
            </strong>This is a more sensitive electrical test to diagnose MG. This test involves inserting a small needle electrode, into the forehead or a forearm muscle to record the differences in response time between a pair of muscle fibers. This test is technically demanding and takes about an hour to perform. <br>
            <br>
            10% of patients with MG have an associated tumour of the thymus gland (thymoma). Hence, your doctor will order a CT scan of the chest to exclude a thymoma.  </div>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
            Treatment Options</span></h2>
            <br>
            Patients with severe, acute and generalised symptoms (especially involving swallowing and respiration) will usually require hospitalisation for urgent treatment. They can be given a course of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) or few cycles of plasma exchange. IVIG is derived from pooled donor blood and contains normal antibodies that will help to temporarily counteract the abnormal antibodies. Plasmapheresis is a procedure where the abnormal antibodies are filtered out of the body by a machine. <br>
            <br>
            Long-term treatment is achieved by oral medications. Pyridostigmine prevents degradation of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction. It is usually given to improve weakness. <br>
            <br>
            Most patients will require immunosuppression to control the disease. Steroids (e.g. Prednisolone) are the mainstay of treatment. Initial treatment requires fairly high dose of this drug. Once the disease is under control, the dosage will be gradually reduced to the minimum. Side effects of steroids include weight gain, fluid retention, acne, development of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis and hip fractures. However, most of these adverse events can be minimised with stringent diet modifications and medications like bisphosphonates. <br>
            <br>
            Your doctor may also prescribe another drug such as azathioprine that will help to reduce the amount of steroids required. This drug takes a while to take effect. Patients on immunosuppressants will require frequent blood checks (full blood count and liver function tests) at the start of treatment and at regular intervals. No medications should be stopped abruptly.<br>
            <br>
            Surgical removal of the thymus gland (thymectomy) is mandatory if a thymoma is seen on the CT chest. Its value is less clear when there is no obvious enlargement although most authorities believe it would improve the long-term control of MG and would consider it in patients less than 60 years old. </div>

            <strong><em>Living with Myasthenia Gravis<br>
            </em></strong><br>
            Although there is no quick cure for Myasthenia Gravis, the outlook for most patients is good. With proper treatment and adequate control, remission may be achieved in many patients. Most patients can expect to live normal or near normal lives with no decrease in life expectancy.</div>
