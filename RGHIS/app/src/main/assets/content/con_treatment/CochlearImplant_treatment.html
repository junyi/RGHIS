            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Frequently Asked Questions</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Who should get a Cochlear Implant?</strong></p>
            <p>A cochlear implant may be considered for the following:</p>
            <p>(a) Adults and children with a severe-to-profound or profound sensory hearing loss in both ears, who received limited benefit from hearing aids.</p>
            <p>(b) Those who do not have any medical conditions that would prevent them from undergoing a surgical procedure.</p>
            <p>(c) Those who have the support of friends and family.</p>
            <p>(d) Those who want to be part of the hearing world.</p>
            <p>(e) Children who will be enrolled into an education programme that stresses auditory and verbal language development.</p>
            <p>(f) Children as young as one year of age may be implanted. It is usually said that the earlier the implantation, the better the outcome will be.</p>
            <p><strong>What are the benefits of having a Cochlear Implant?</strong></p>
            <p>The outcome varies with each individual and is influenced by: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The age at which the hearing loss occurred </li>
                <li>How long it's been since the hearing loss occurred </li>
                <li>The integrity of the auditory nerve </li>
                <li>Motivation and emotional support from family and friends </li>
                <li>The amount of practice and training in the early stages of implant </li>
                <li>What are the follow-ups required after surgery? </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The implant has to be programmed by the audiologist before it can work. Programming of the implant will be carried out 2 to 3 weeks after surgery, after which the implant needs to be programmed periodically to maximise the speech sounds that can be heard by the individual.</p>
            <p>A period of (re)habilitation is also required, especially in children, to gain the maximum benefits from listening through the implant. Implanted children will be enrolled in therapy sessions in Listen and Talk Programme, where the Auditory-Verbal approach is adopted to help children develop speech and language.</p>
            <p><strong>What should my expectations be?</strong></p>
            <p>A Cochlear Implant may not be the right choice for everyone. An evaluation by an experienced cochlear implant team will help you to decide.</p>
            <p>No Cochlear Implant is able to restore normal hearing completely. However, with the Cochlear Implant, adults can look forward to hearing sounds that may help them to carry on a conversation and participate in everyday life.</p>
            <p>The outcome in children varies, but the ultimate objective is that children can develop speech and language. For further information, please do not hesitate to contact us for an appointment.</p>
