            <p>Mild problems may be treated with changes in your diet and constipating medications. You may be started on simple exercise that strengthens the anal muscles. </p>
            <p>In other cases, biofeedback can be used to help patients sense when stool is ready to be evacuated and help strengthen the muscles. Injuries to the anal muscles may be repaired with surgery. Diseases, which cause inflammation in the colon and rectum, such as colitis, may contribute to anal control problems. Treating these diseases also may eliminate or improve symptoms of incontinence.</p>
            <p>In the past, patients with no hope of regaining bowel control required a colostomy. This is rarely required nowadays. Artificial anal muscle, currently still under research, may soon find a place in treating patients with difficult control problems.</p>
