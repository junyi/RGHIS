            <p><strong>Self Medication</strong></p>
            <p>Diarrhoea can usually be treated effectively by self medication. The mainstay of therapy is adequate hydration. Illness are usually self limiting and does not require any specific medical therapy. The overwhelming majority of adults have mild diarrhoea that will not lead to dehydration provided adequate fluids is taken. Hydration can be achieved by drinking boiled barley or rice water with sprinkle of salt. This formulation helps to increase water absorption across the gut wall. An easier way is to consume commercially available oral rehydration salts in tablets or sachets form ( Rehidrat, Dioralyte ). This tablets can be drunk after reconstitution in boiled water (Please read the manufacturer's instruction for methods of dilution). Most people will find it more comfortable to rest the bowel for a few days by avoiding high fibre, high fat foods. Frequent feedings of fruit drinks, tea, de-fizzed carbonated beverages and soft easily digested foods ( eg. soups, crackers) are encouraged.</p>
            <p>Routine use of antibiotics is not recommended as illness is self limiting. Antibiotics are indicated for those persons with high fever and prolonged diarrhoea. Antibiotics are used in diarrhoea due to invasive bacterial agents ( shigella, salmonella) as antibiotics are believed to reduce environmental contamination. <br>
            Anti diarrhoeal agents ( such Lomotil) works by decreasing the bowel contraction and may be used to decrease frequeny of diarrhoea, liquidity of stool and abdominal cramps. It should not be used if there is high fever and blood is present in stool indicating severe large bowel inflammation. This drug should also be discontinued and medical advice should be saught if diarrhoea is worsening after few days of therapy.</p>
            <p>Avoidance of milk and milk products is recommended for the first few weeks to avoid worsening of the diarrhoea from lactase deficiency. Gastroenteritis can reduce concentration of the enzyme lactase and thus the ability of small bowel to digest lactose present in milk. </p>
