            <p>The first and most important step in treatment is to identify and avoid your allergy triggers. Your doctor may also prescribe allergy medications to reduce your symptoms. The medication depends on the type of allergy and can be over-the-counter or prescription drugs in the form of oral medications, nasal sprays or eye drops. </p>
            <p>In severe allergies, your doctor may suggest allergy shots. Also called immunotherapy, this treatment involves a series of injections of purified allergen extracts, given usually over a period of a few years. </p>
