            Treatment</span></h2>
            <p>After completion of staging, in some hospitals, patients may be discussed in a multidisciplinary tumour board, comprising surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians. All treatment options will be presented to patients, together with recommendations. </p>
            <p>Stage 1 and 2 cancers are considered early-stage disease and a single modality of treatment is usually sufficient. This may be surgery or radiotherapy. Chemotherapy alone is not the treatment of choice for head and neck cancers.</p>
            <p>Stage 3 and 4 cancers are considered advanced-stage disease and require multiple modality treatment.</p>
            <p>This involves various combinations of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Surgery followed by radiation </li>
                <li>Surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation </li>
                <li>Chemotherapy and radiation alone </li>
