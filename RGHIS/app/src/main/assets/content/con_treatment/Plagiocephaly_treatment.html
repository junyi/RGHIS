<h2>Treatment Options</h2>
<p>Many children with deformational plagiocephaly do not need any treatment at all, because the condition can improve naturally as the child grows and begins to sit up. For children where treatment is necessary, it is important to see a specialist (plastic surgeon) between four and eight months of age. This is because the greatest amount of correction will occur before 12 months of age. Treatment is provided by a team including a plastic surgeon, orthotist and paediatric physiotherapist.</p>
