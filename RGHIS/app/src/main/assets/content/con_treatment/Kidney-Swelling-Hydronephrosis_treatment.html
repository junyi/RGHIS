            Babies with hydronephrosis need kidney ultrasounds and kidney function scans. Sometimes the babies (and the kidney) improve with time without surgery. Generally, a few investigations will be needed over time before it can be known if any operation is required. <br>
            <br>
            Treatment depends on the underlying cause; for children diagnosed with PUJO, an operation called a pyeloplasty will be needed if the hydronephrosis causes back pressure on the kidney. This is a major operation, but most often has a very high cure rate and a low chance of any complications.<br>
