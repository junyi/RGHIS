            <p><strong>Treatment of Brain Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            <strong>Surgery</strong> reduces the amount of brain cells cancer and also provides the pathologist (doctor who looks at tissues under the microscope) with tissue to diagnose the exact type of brain cancer. Patients who have increased pressure within the skull because of the brain cancer sometimes need to have a shunt put in surgically leading from within the skull to the abdomen. This shunt drains some of the fluid within the skull and therefore reduces some of the pressure within the skull.</p>
            <p><strong>Radiotherapy</strong> is often indicated once the diagnosis of brain cancer is made. Radiotherapy consists of high-energy rays directed onto the cancer and the surrounding tissues. Usually 5 to 8 weeks of radiotherapy is delivered. Patients may experience hair loss and some lethargy during the treatment period.</p>
            <p><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> is not always used. Fast growing brain cancers respond better to chemotherapy than slow growing brain cancers. Patients who have recurred after surgery and radiotherapy or patients whose cancers have not responded well to radiotherapy are considered for chemotherapy. Chemotherapy drugs are given orally as well as by injections.</p>
            <p>Recently, the use of wafers containing drugs and implanted into the brain cancer at the time of surgery to reduce the growth of the cancer has been studied. </p>
            <p><strong>Prognosis of Brain Cancer<br>
            </strong><br>
            Clinical examinations, x-rays and pathology reports all help the medical team decide what the progress of an individual case of brain cancer may be. Then, the appropriate course of treatment will be put into action. The treatment strategy will vary from person to person. With prompt and appropriate treatment, the outlook for a person with brain cancer is reasonable. The doctor looks for certain features. Young patients survive longer than older patients with brain cancer. Other features that are important are the patient's exact type of brain cancer, the extent of brain function affected by the cancer and whether the cancer can be operated on.</p>

            Frequently Asked Questions</span></h2>
            <p><strong>I have headaches all the time. Can I be suffering from brain cancer?<br>
            </strong><br>
            Headaches have many causes, such as stress, eyesight problems, and migraine. Seek medical consultation if there are worrisome symptoms, such as vomiting, double vision, weakness of one side of the body, seizures or if the headache is getting progressively worse.</p>
            <p><strong>My mother had breast cancer. Now she has brain cancer. Why does she have so many illnesses? Will she die soon?<br>
            </strong><br>
            When breast cancer spreads to the brain, the cancer cells there are still breast cancer cells. It is an advanced stage of breast cancer. With appropriate treatment some of her symptoms may be controlled. Cancer spread to the brain does not necessary mean it is immediately life-threatening after appropriate treatment.</p>
