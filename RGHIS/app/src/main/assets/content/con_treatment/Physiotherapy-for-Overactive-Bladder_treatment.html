<h2>What Are The Treatment Options For An Overactive Bladder? </h2>
<ul>
    <li>Medication which may be prescribed by your doctor to help relax the bladder and relieve the sensation of urgency. Estrogen may be inserted vaginally if you are menopausal. </li>
    <li>Behavioural Therapy which comprises a Bladder Retraining Program where you are taught to empty the bladder at regular intervals. In addition, distraction relaxation and / or perineal pressure techniques may be incorporated to help you overcome the sense of urgency. </li>
    <li>Pelvic Floor Exercises are designed to strengthen the sphincter muscles thereby reducing incontinence episodes and severity. </li>
    <li class=last>Electrical Stimulation reduces the contraction of the bladder muscles and improves the bladder capacity for urine storage. </li>
</ul>
<h2>The Role Of The Physiotherapist</h2>
<p>The physiotherapist will assess your condition and review your 'bladder diary' (frequency-volume chart). This chart monitors your frequency of passing urine and the volume of urine passed each time and incontinence episodes. The physiotherapist will review you on a fortnightly interval to monitor progress. Based on the findings, your physiotherapist will prescribe therapy that best suits your needs. You can stop seeing the physiotherapist after you have achieved good bladder habits and do not have urinary leakage.</p>
<h2>Rehabilitation Department</h2>
<p>The Rehabilitation Department offers a wide range of therapy services for both women and children. </p>
<p>Our team of dedicated activity therapist, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech-language therapists strive to deliver high quality specialised services to all patients.</p>
<h2>Physiotherapy</h2>
<p>Physiotherapy is the first line of treatment for some urogynaecological conditions like urinary and pelvic organ prolapses. Physiotherapy treatment is safe and non-invasive and is an option before surgery is considered. Patients are often referred to the physiotherapist by the gynaecologist or urogynaecologist.</p>
<h2>Here We Are</h2>
<p>Rehabilitation Department is located on Basement One of the Children's Tower, KK Women's &amp; Children Hospital.</p>
