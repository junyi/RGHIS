<h2>Home Care For Attacks Of Stridor With Croup</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Your doctor may prescribe Dexamethasone to your child. This is a steroid which helps to reduce the swelling of the windpipe and vocal cords, and thus relieves the breathing difficulties. Cough medicine may be given to help clear the secretions. </li>
    <li><strong>Warm fluids for coughing spasms:</strong> Coughing spasms are often due to sticky mucus caught on the vocal cords. Warm clear fluids may help relax the vocal cords and loosen up the mucus. </li>
    <li><strong>Smoke exposure:</strong> Avoid anyone smoking around your child. Smoke makes the croup worse. </li>
    <li><strong>Close observation:</strong> Sleep in the same room as your child so that you can monitor him closely. </li>
    <li class=last><strong>Consult your doctor if: </strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Breathing becomes difficult or the stridor returns (when your child is at rest) </li>
        <li>The child is lethargic </li>
        <li>There is poor feeding </li>
        <li>Your child appears pale or blue - LATE SIGN! </li>
        <li class=last>Croup lasts more than 1 week </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
