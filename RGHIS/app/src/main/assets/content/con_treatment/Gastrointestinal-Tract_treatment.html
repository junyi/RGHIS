            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD)</span></h2>
            <p>OGD is often used as the investigation if you have symptoms of indigestion, dyspepsia, heartburn, upper abdominal pain or weight loss. It allows examination of your gullet, stomach and duodenum. Small pieces of the lining of the stomach ( biopsies ) can be taken for examination under the microscopes. Biopsies can be safely taken without any pain or discomfort or bleeding unless you are on anti-coagulant. You would therefore need to inform your doctor if you are on aspirin or warfarin before the test is performed. </p>
            <p><strong><em>Procedure<br>
            </em></strong>It is often performed on outpatient basis but you would require to be fasted overnight. Before the scope is inserted, your throat would be sprayed with local anaesthetic ( lignocaine spray ). Intravenous sedation is sometimes given for anxious patients though this would mean having a small needle inserted into your forearm vein and you would also be required to be accompanied home after the procedure. The scope is then passed through your mouth across the back of your throat into your gullet (oesophagus). The scope is then maneuvered into your stomach and duodenum. The test usually lasts for 5 to 10 minutes. It is extremely safe though it has been reported to cause complication of heart attacks in elderly patients. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Colonoscopy</span></h2>
            <p>This test allows visualisation of your whole large bowel and the last part of small bowel. The success rate for having a complete examination to the uppermost part of the large bowel is around 95%. Biopsies can be taken and small <strong>polyps</strong> can be removed at the time of colonoscopy. Your doctor would remove the polyps if they are found during the examination as they may lead to large bowel cancer if they are left on place after 15 to 20 years. You would not feel any pain if biopsies are taken or polyps removed. </p>
            <p><strong><em>Procedure<br>
            </em></strong>You would be required to undergo low residue diet (avoiding vegetables, fruits, all bran products) for two days and to go on clear fluids one day before the test. On the afternoon before the test, you would be given some medicine by your doctor to purge your bowel. You would be given intravenous sedation and the instruments would be passed into your anus and maneuvered around to the uppermost part of your large bowel. </p>
            <p>The major complications of the test are perforations and bleeding. Perforations are leak from the large bowel wall. The risk if these two complications increases if your doctors are required to remove polyps. From the medical literature, the rate of these complications occurring is about 1/1000. </p>
