<h2>Where Can You Get Help?</h2>
<p>Occupational therapists have successfully identified and treated sensory defensiveness for many years. It is important that the diagnosis be made by a knowledgeable therapist through a careful sensory history review.</p>
<p>If your child displays some or all of the symptoms, and your daily routines are severely affected by the child's behaviour, you may wish to bring your child to see the occupational therapist for an assessment.</p>
<p>To consult an occupational therapist at KK Hospital's Department of Child Development or Rehabilitation department, you will need a referral letter from your KKH doctor.</p>
