            Treatment</span></h2>
            <br>
            Treatment options may include : <br>
            <br>
            - <strong>Lifestyle changes</strong> such as quitting smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, losing excess weight, and increasing physical activity may help some men regain sexual function. <br>
            <br>
            - <strong>Cutting back on or replacing medicines</strong> that could be causing ED. <br>
            <br>
            - <strong>Psychotherapy.</strong> Techniques that decrease anxiety associated with intercourse can be taught together with the help of the partner. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>- Oral or locally injected drugs <br>
            </strong>a. Oral drugs called phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors enhance the eff ects of nitric oxide, a chemical that relaxes smooth muscles in the penis during sexual stimulation and allows increased blood flow in the penis. Men who take nitrate-based drugs such as nitroglycerin pills for heart problems should not use any of these drugs because the combination can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure. <br>
            <br>
            b. Drugs such as prostaglandin E1, papaverine hydrochloride, and phentolamine, are injected into the shaft of the penis to relax the smooth muscles of the corpora cavernosa, causing it to become engorged with blood. Patients using such medications should be warned about persistent erection, known as priapism, which requires emergency treatment. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>- Vacuum erection devices</strong> Mechanical vacuum devices cause an erection by creating a partial vacuum, which draws blood into the corpora cavernosa, engorging and expanding the penis. An elastic ring is moved from the end of the cylinder to the base of the penis as the cylinder is removed to maintain the erection. <br>
            <br>
            <span style="color:#000000"><strong>- Surgery</strong> <br>
            </span><strong>a. Penile implant.</strong> Implanted devices, known as prostheses, can restore erection in many men with ED. The implants may be malleable implants or infl atable implants. Once a man has either a malleable or infl atable implant, he must use the device to have an erection. Possible problems with implants include mechanical breakdown and infection, although the incidents of mechanical problems have decreased in recent years because of technological advances. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>b. Vascular surgery.</strong> Surgery may be performed to repair arteries with discrete blockage because of an injury to the groin or fracture of the pelvis. Surgery to block off veins, called ligation, can reduce the leakage of blood that diminishes the rigidity of the penis during an erection.<br>
