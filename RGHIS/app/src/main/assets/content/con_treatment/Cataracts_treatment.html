<h2>How can my Cataract be treated?<br>
 </h2>
The notion of a cataract being 'ripe' for surgery is a myth. Surgery will usually be advised by your surgeon when your poor vision caused by cataract cannot be corrected with glasses and interferes with your daily activities. Our surgeons are able to perform cataract surgery using techniques, machines and instruments, making cataract surgery comfortable, safe and quick to recover from.<br>
     <br>
Pre-operatively, your surgeon will counsel you regarding the surgical process, including discussing with you the expected outcome and possible risks and complications from the surgery. Our team of nurses and counselors will also advise you of the dos and donв„ўts after the surgery.<br>
<br>
Elective cataract surgery is performed as a day/ambulatory surgery, under local or topical anaesthesia, on one eye at a time. A short period of fasting is required before the operation. The vast majority of our cataract operations are by a technique called phacoemulsification. This uses <strong>ultrasound</strong> energy.  <br>
<span style="color:#ffffff">SNEC has introduced <strong>Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Cataract Surgery</strong> to Singapore.  Click </span><a xxxx="http://www.snec.com.sg/eye-conditions-and-treatments/common-eye-conditions-and-procedures/Pages/femtosecond-laser.aspx"><span style="color:#ffffff">here </span></a><span style="color:#ffffff">to know more about the difference with conventional cataract surgery and the benefits to patients.<br>
</span>Phacoemulsification involves making a small incision of 1.8 to 3.0mm on the cornea. The vibrating phacoemulsification instrument is introduced into the eye through the small wound. It causes<br>
emulsification (softening) of the cataractous lens which is aspirated out through the instrument at the same time. The capsule of the lens is left behind which then receives the artificial lens implant. The surgery is completed without any need for stitches. <br>

Post-operatively, you will need to instill eyedrops into the operated eye at regular intervals for up to 4 weeks. Light activities and good hygiene are advised. Potential contaminants to the healing wound such as from swimming and hair-washing should be avoided. Your experienced nurse will be able to advise you further of the details of your post-operative eye care. You should also return for check-ups at one day, within one week and at about a month from your operation.<br>
<br>
The eye specialists at the Singapore National Eye Centre perform over 10,000 cataract surgeries a year. We will continue to be instrumental in bringing advanced microsurgical techniques and lens implant technology to the nation and region.
