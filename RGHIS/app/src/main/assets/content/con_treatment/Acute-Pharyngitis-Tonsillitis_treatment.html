            Treatment</span></h2>
            <p>Acute tonsillitis caused by a virus is usually self-limiting and symptomatic treatment is sufficient. However, if the tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, antibiotics may be prescribed that needs to be completed. Stopping the antibiotics prematurely may lead to the bacteria developing a resistance to it. <br>
            <br>
            <strong><span style="color:#000000">Self-care <br>
            <br>
            </span></strong>Most cases of tonsillitis are caused by viral infection and antibiotics is not necessary. It is usually self-limiting and symptomatic treatment to relieve pain and inflammation is all that is required. It takes about a week for full recovery. Drinking lots of water to prevent dehydration is usually advised. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Drink warm, soothing liquids - such as soup, broth and tea. </li>
                <li>Gargle with warm salt water. </li>
                <li>Take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help reduce fever and decrease pain. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Children should not be prescribed aspirin because of the risk of Reyeв„ўs syndrome - a potentially life-threatening illness causing encephalopathy (brain damage) and fatty liver. Persons diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis should not exert themselves or engage in strenuous activity for a month for fear of splenic rupture. <br>
            <br>
            <strong><span style="color:#000000">Surgery <br>
            <br>
            </span></strong>Surgical removal of the tonsils (tonsillectomy) for tonsillitis may be recommended when a patient has: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Seven or more serious throat infections in one year </li>
                <li>Five or more serious throat infections every year over a two year period </li>
                <li>Three or more serious throat infections every year over a threeyear period </li>
                <li>Chronic tonsillitis </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Tonsillectomy may also be recommended to treat an abscess that does not improve with antibiotic treatment, or if breathing is blocked by swollen tonsils. <br>
            <br>
            Tonsillectomy is usually done as a day surgical procedure. This means that you will be able to go home on the day of the surgery. A complete recovery may take up to two weeks.</p>
