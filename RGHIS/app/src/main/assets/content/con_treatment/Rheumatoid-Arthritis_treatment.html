            <p>Upon confirmation of the diagnosis of RA, the attending doctor will determine the type of medication suitable for the patient based on individual requirements. Examples of medications used to treat RA are NSAIDS (Diclofenac), prednisolone, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and TNF - blockers such as etanercept and infl iximab. The attending doctor may also arrange for the patient to meet the rheumatology nurse clinician, physiotherapist and occupational therapists, if appropriate. <br>
            <br>
            RA causes mainly joint but possibly other organ inflammation as well. Referral for evaluation should be considered as soon as possible if RA is suspected so that appropriate treatment can be given to prevent permanent organ damage. At the moment, there is no cure for RA but rapid research developments have given rise to treatments that have enabled people affected by RA to live normal lives.</p>
