            The testicles will normally descend without intervention. Otherwise treatment should be sought. Early treatment is necessary to prevent an increased risk of infertility and development of testicular cancer later in life. However, the condition itself is painless and presents no immediate health problems. <br>
            <br>
            If only one testicle has not descended ' it should be found and correctly placed for the boy at around one year of age. This operation is called an orchidopexy. It is a routine day surgery procedure and generally has few complications. A boy with one normal testicle will have normal hormone production and normal sperm production.<br>
