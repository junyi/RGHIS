            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">When To Seek Help</span></h2>
            <p>If your child has not been able to pay attention or concentrate and has been hyperactive and behaving impulsively for some time, you should take him or her to a developmental paediatrician. </p>
            <p>In addition to a body checkup and the right laboratory tests, the doctor may ask the parents and teachers to fill in questionnaires about the childв„ўs behaviour. The doctor may also refer parents to a psychologist or mental health doctor for further checks. Following this, your child may be given medication and options for behavioural or psychological treatments.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Treatment Options</span></h2>
            <p><strong><em>Medication</em></strong></p>
            <p>Medications such as stimulants have been used for a long time to treat ADHD by reducing the chemical imbalance in the brain. These medications are not tranquilisers or sedatives. They do not slow down the nervous system but actually stimulate various parts of the brain so that its focusing and self-control functions work better. Medication must be used together with educating the child and family for behaviour change. </p>
            <p><strong><em>Psychological Treatment</em></strong></p>
            <p>Research has shown that behaviour therapy and other psychological treatments can have a positive effect on the childв„ўs condition. They should be used together with medication for best effect. Counselling may also be used to help build self-esteem that has been damaged as a result of having ADHD.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Diet and Nutrition</em></strong></p>
            <p>Research has shown that a change in diet and nutrition does not effectively treat ADHD. Obviously, a good diet is recommended for the well being of anybody. Taking sweets out of the diet does reduce the symptoms in some children but it usually does not fully control the condition. </p>
            <p>Many new &quot;natural&quot; products have been launched as &quot;cures&quot; for ADHD. Be careful of what is sold out there as some products may be harmful to your child.</p>
