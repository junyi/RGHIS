<h2>Medical Attention </h2>
<p>OHSS is usually self-limiting and can then be treated at home with rest and adequate fluid intake. Immediate medical attention is required should the symptoms persist or worsen. In this instance, admission to hospital for treatment and close monitoring are required. Most of the time, the symptoms will subside in 5 to 15 days.</p>
<p>You should report any concern at any time to the KKIVF Centre or the Women's 24-Hour Clinic, which is located at Basement 1, Women's Tower.</p>

<h2>Prevention </h2>
<p>Prevention is the best form of treatment and we will endeavor to avoid OHSS at all stages.</p>
<p>Some women are more likely to develop OHSS, especially those with polycystic ovaries, those who are thin and those who had responded with many follicles or experienced OHSS in the past.</p>
<p>At KKIVF, we may recommend abandoning the cycle before the hCG injection if your risks of OHSS are high or unexpected rigorous response is encountered in your cycle.</p>
<p>If you are undergoing the IVF/ICSI programmes, your eggs may be collected but you may not have fresh embryo transfer. The resulting good quality embryos will be frozen for later use.</p>
<h2>Hotlines</h2>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact us if you are feeling well. You may be asked to come to the hospital and be assessed by a doctor.</p>
