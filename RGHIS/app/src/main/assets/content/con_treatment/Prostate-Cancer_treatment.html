            <p><strong>Diagnostic Tests</strong><br>
            <br>
            The prostate is located in front of the rectum. It can therefore be examined with a gloved finger in the rectum by a doctor. Apart from physical examination, blood tests (Prostate specific antigen or PSA) help to diagnose prostate cancer. To confirm prostate cancer, small pieces of tissue from the prostate gland are removed, and examined under the microscope. In order to find out the extent of prostate cancer, CT or MRI scans are performed. A bone scan is also done to see if the bones are affected as this is the most common site of spread. </p>

            <p><strong>Treatment of Prostate Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            Some cases of localized prostate can be managed with active surveillance<sup>1</sup>. <strong>Surgery</strong> for prostate cancer involves removal of the entire prostate gland and nearby tissue. There may be complications after surgery such as impotence and difficulty controlling urine because delicate nerves may be damaged during the procedure.</p>
            <p><strong>Radiation therapy</strong> is the use of high-energy rays focused on the cancer. It has an important role to play in the treatment of prostate cancer. Radiotherapy may be used instead of surgery for early prostate cancer<sup>2</sup>. It may also be given to patients with advanced cancer that has spread to the bones, to relieve pain.</p>
            <p>Prostate cancer depends on male sex hormones to grow; therefore blocking the production of male sex hormones is one strategy to control the growth of prostate cancer. This can be achieved with drugs (hormonal therapy) or removal of both testes (bilateral orchidectomy). Some male hormones come from the adrenal glands, small glands that sit on top of the kidneys. There are agents that can stop the production of these hormones from the adrenal glands. When hormonal therapy no longer works in patients with advanced prostate cancer, chemotherapy may be used<sup>3</sup>. </p>
            <p><strong>Prognosis of Prostate Cancer<br>
            </strong><br>
            Clinical examinations scans and pathology reports all help the medical team to decide what the progress of prostate cancer is. The appropriate course of treatment may then be recommended. The treatment strategy will vary from person to person. Prognosis of prostate cancer depends on the extent of the disease, the state of health of the individual as well as response to treatment.</p>
