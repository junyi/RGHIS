            Treatment</span></h1>
            <p>Treatment of both snoring and OSA requires a multidisciplinary and logical approach. </p>
            <h1><span style="text-decoration:underline">1. Treatment for Snoring </span></h1>
            <p><strong><span style="color:#ff6600">Conservative treatment <br>
            </span></strong>This includes eliminating outside factors that may be playing a role. These include : </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Weight loss </li>
                <li>Avoidance of alcohol or other medications </li>
                <li>Treatment of nasal congestion with medications </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In patients with significant snoring, these efforts are rarely successful. An evaluation by an Otolaryngologist is needed to rule out sleep apnoea. <br>
            <br>
            <strong><span style="color:#ff6600">Surgical treatment <br>
            </span></strong>If a person wants treatment, several options exist that are directed at the soft palate, nasal and base of tongue. Most treatments are directed at the soft palate (soft tissue at the back of the roof of the mouth) since this is the most common site of snoring. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Surgery of the soft palate</strong> is effective in 80-90% of cases and can be associated with postoperative pain for 7-10 days. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>In the nose,</strong> normal structures called turbinates may be enlarged from allergic rhinitis causing airflow blockage. Reduction of the turbinates using radiofrequency or surgical reduction (turbinectomy) may be performed. The septum that divides the nose into two sides may also be crooked and needs to be straightened. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>The base of tongue and lingual tonsils</strong> (lymphatic tissues at the back of the tongue) may be enlarged and impede airflow during sleep. Obstruction at these sites can be treated by a variety of methods depending on severity. </p>
            <h1><span style="text-decoration:underline">2. Treatment for Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) <br>
            </span></h1>
            <p>Indications for treatment of OSA include excessive daytime sleepiness with altered daytime performance, moderate to severe OSA, decreased blood oxygen saturation level, and cardiovascular complications (hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias and stroke). <br>
            <br>
            Treatment of OSA can prevent cardiovascular complications and improve daytime sleepiness, decrease OSA-related road traffic accidents and work-place accidents and improve quality of life. Current treatment options include conservative and surgical methods.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><span style="color:#ff6600">Conservative treatment <br>
            </span></strong>This includes eliminating outside factors that may be playing a role. Other factors to consider include : </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Weight loss </li>

                <li>Treatment of nasal congestion with medications </li>
            </ul>
            <p>You will be advised to sleep on the side rather than on your back. In someone with significant snoring, these efforts are rarely successful. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)</strong> is the first treatment option. It is applied via a nasal or face mask and works by providing an
