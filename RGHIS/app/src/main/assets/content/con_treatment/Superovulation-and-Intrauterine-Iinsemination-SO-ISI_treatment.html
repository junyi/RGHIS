<h2>How Is The Procedure Done?</h2>
<p>The procedure is done on an outpatient basis.</p>
<p>Fertility drugs are given for 10 days or more to produce between two to three mature follicles. These drugs may be either injections (gonadotrophins) alone or a combination of tablets (Clomiphene) and injections. Ultrasound scans are done at intervals to determine the number and size of the follicles before another injection (HCG) is given for final maturation and subsequent ovulation of these follicles.</p>
<p>On the day of the insemination, the couple has to bring the husbandв„ўs semen sample to the hospital. The semen is prepared and the motile fraction is then placed into the uterus using a fine catheter through the cervix.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Superovulation &amp; Intrauterine Insemination Procedure</em></p>
<p>The patient is then started on medications to help improve the chances of implantation and thus pregnancy. A blood test (serum progesterone) is taken seven days after the insemination to monitor the effectiveness of these medications. The patient should return to KKIVF 17 days after the insemination for a pregnancy test.</p>
<h2>Useful Information </h2>
<h2>Success rates (KKIVF rates)</h2>
<p>Natural conception in a fertile couple aged about 35 years old occurs about 15% per month. When infertility factors are present, this is much reduced.</p>
<p>SOIUI improves the chances of conception for infertile couples and the average success rate is about 12-15% per cycle or 26% per patient after 3 cycles. </p>
<p>The overall success rate varies with the cause of infertility and the age of the female partner. For some conditions, the pregnancy rate can be as high as 36% per patient.</p>

Other disappointments include miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies (a pregnancy occurring inside the fallopian tube).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At KKIVF, there is also a 12% chance of multiple pregnancy occurring, usually a twin pregnancy. Occasionally, we will have a triplet or a quadruplet pregnancy. However, this is rare, as we will monitor your cycles very closely.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For enquiries, please contact our KKIVF Nurse Coordinators at +65 6394 1694 or fax at +65 6293 6415.
