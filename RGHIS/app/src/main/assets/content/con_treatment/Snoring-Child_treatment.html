<h2>What Are The Treatment Options?</h2>
<h2>Surgery</h2>
<p>In many children, enlarged tonsils and adenoids are the cause of OSAHS and your doctor will recommend removing them. The procedure is called adenotonsillectomy. Other types of surgery, such as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (when the uvula, tonsils and part of the soft palate are removed) and various types of jaw and facial surgery may be recommended if your child has a structural problem which is causing the OSAHS. Tracheostomy (opening a hole in the windpipe at the neck) is generally used only in life threatening OSAHS with no other suitable treatment available. </p>
<p>Sometimes surgery can stop snoring even though it does not cure OSAHS. A second sleep study may be needed to be sure OSAHS has been cured. Follow the advice of your sleep specialist.</p>
<h2>Positive Airway Pressure (PAP)</h2>
<p>PAP is a small mask worn over the nose during sleep. The mask provides air pressure that keeps the throat from closing during sleep. PAP may be used to prepare the child before surgery and is also helpful for children when surgical treatment is not possible or desirable, or when surgery does not cure the OSAHS.</p>
<h2>Weight Loss</h2>
<p>If your sleep specialist thinks that obesity may be contributing to your child's OSAHS, he may recommend weight loss by means of a combined diet, exercise and behavioural program. Even if other treatments are used, weight loss in the obese child with OSAHS helps to control OSAHS and sometimes lead to a cure.</p>
