<h2>In the case if a mother who cannot give up smoking totally, how many would be permissible?</h2>
<p>There is a graduated fetal response to maternal inhaled smoke. That is, the more cigarettes the mother smokes, the more risks for the fetus. There is no cut off point where smoking can be said to not affect the unborn baby. The best advice is not to smoke at all during pregnancy.</p>
