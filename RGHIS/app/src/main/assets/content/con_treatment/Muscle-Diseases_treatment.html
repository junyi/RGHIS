            <p><strong>NNI Neuromuscular Clinics</strong></p>
            <p>The NNI provides a comprehensive and specialised service for the diagnosis and care of muscle diseases. Medical consultations are offered at the <strong>Neuromuscular Clinics</strong>, which are staffed by <strong>neurologists with special expertise in muscle diseases</strong>. The Neurodiagnostic Laboratory conducts electromyography and nerve conduction studies, useful tests that examine electrical signals derived from muscle and nerve. <br>
            <br>
            The Neuromuscular Laboratory provide muscle histology studies, which are often essential for the specific diagnosis of muscle diseases. For these studies, a small sample of muscle is first obtained, usually under local anaesthesia. The sample is then cut into thin sections and stained with a battery of stains for examination and analysis. Techniques used include histochemistry, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Gene tests for several inherited muscle diseases will soon be available following the setting up of the Neurogenetics Laboratory.</p>
            <p>Physical therapy and physical aids may be required to help extend independence and prevent complications. If the disease is genetic or inherited, counselling patients on the diseaseв„ўs inheritance pattern will help them to make informed choices in planning for the future. Social or psychological assistance may be needed. The fundamental goal is to help and encourage patients and their families surmount the challenges of muscle disease to achieve an active and fulfilling life.</p>
