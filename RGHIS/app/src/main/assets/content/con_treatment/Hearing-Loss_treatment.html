            Treatment</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Medical <br>
            </strong>Medical treatment depends on the underlying problem. Treatment may range from observation and reassurance to medications and a discussion on surgical options. If the cause of hearing loss is due to wax and foreign body in the ear canal, it can be removed under a microscope by the ENT surgeon. <br>
            <br>
            In cases of external ear infections, topical antibiotic is needed. If there is an eardrum perforation, the underlying infection has to be treated. Surgical repair of the ear perforation may be necessary if the perforation persists for more than three months or there is a problem of recurrent ear infections with ear discharge. If the cause of the hearing loss is due to medication, the medication will be stopped or changed. <br>
            <br>
            For presbycusis (hearing loss due to old age) no treatment is needed although the affected individual will be advised to protect his hearing and evaluated on whether hearing aid help is needed.<br>

            <strong><span style="color:#ff6600">Hearing Aids</span></strong><span style="color:#ff6600"> <br>
            </span>Conventional hearing aids are amplification devices that detect environmental sounds and present and amplify them into the external ear canal. They are useful for both conductive as well as sensorineural hearing loss. The modern aids vary from very small completely-in-the-canal to the traditional behind the ear hearing aids. A trained audiologist will help customise the hearing aid for optimal sound. <br>
            <br>
            The side effects from wearing hearing aids include occlusion effect (sense of blockage of the ear), feedback and a propensity for ear infections. <br>
            <br>
            <strong><span style="color:#ff6600">Hearing Implants <br>
            </span></strong>With advances in technology, implants to aid hearing have been developed. Two main types of surgical implants are available. Middle ear implants are used in people who have tried hearing aids but are unable to use them or fail to benefit from them. It can be used for those with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss. It comprises of a transducer that is attached to the ossicles or directly to the round window (part of the cochlea). It vibrates the middle ear structures and amplifies the transmission of sound. <br>
            <br>
            Cochlear implants are used in someone with moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss. The ENT surgeon will insert the electrical electrode of the implant directly into the cochlea and directly stimulate the nerve endings in the cochlea so as to bypass any problem in the cochlea. Cochlear implants are used in both paediatrics and adults.</p>
