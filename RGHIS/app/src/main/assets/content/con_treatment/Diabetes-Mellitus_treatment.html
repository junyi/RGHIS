                <li>Good control of your blood sugar. </li>
                <li>Good control of blood pressure. </li>
                <li>Use of drugs called Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) </li>
                <li>Cessation of smoking </li>
                <li>Control of blood lipids </li>

            <p><strong>a) Diabetic Diet</strong></p>
            <p>A diabetic diet is one which promotes a healthy balanced diet for all individuals rather than a diet for the sick. The total energy needs of the individual will be calculated at a level to achieve and/or maintain a desirable body weight. The proportion of energy from each of the major energy groups is such that 50-60% of energy should be derived from carbohydrate, 25-30% from fat and 15-20% from protein (The protein intake may need to be reduced in renal disease).</p>
            <p>Do not delay or skip your meals or snacks (if allowed) as this may lead to fluctuations of your blood sugar levels. If in doubt, you should seek medical nutrition therapy from a qualified dietitian who will help tailor a meal plan to suit your lifestyle and medical condition.</p>
            <p><strong>b) Exercise</strong></p>
            <p>Regular exercise is an important part of diabetes control and should be part of your daily routine.</p>
            <p>Exercise : </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Helps insulin to work better and lower your blood glucose. </li>
                <li>Lowers the blood pressure and cholesterol levels. </li>
                <li>Strengthens the heart and improves blood circulation. </li>
                <li>Reduces body fat and control body weight. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Select an exercise program</strong><br>
            The type of exercise that is suitable for you depends on your age, physical fitness and preferences. You may need to consult your doctor or nurse educator when planning for an exercise program. Choose an exercise that you would enjoy doing. Brisk walking, jogging and cycling are good examples. Exercise regularly, every day if you can or at least 3 times a week and 30 minutes for each session. Plan your programme, start slowly and gradually. Increase the amount of exercise you do each session. </p>
            <p>Always start with warm up (stretching) for 5 ' 10 minutes follow by the actual exercise, and end with cool down exercise, just as you would do for the warm up. </p>
            <p><strong>Points to remember:</strong> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Test your blood glucose before and after exercise. It is not safe to exercise if your blood glucose is above 15 mmol/L, if you are feeling unwell or if there are ketones in your urine. </li>
                <li>If blood glucose is low, eat a snack. </li>
                <li>If blood glucose is normal, you do not need a snack unless you are doing some strenous exercise. </li>
                <li>Alternatively, you can reduce your insulin dose before exercise. Consult your doctor or nurse educator on what is best for you. </li>
                <li>Always carry quick sugar, such as glucose tablets candy etc. With you when you exercise (especially if you are on insulin). Hypoglycaemia (Low blood sugar) may occur during or after exercise due to increased transport of glucose into the muscles by insulin. </li>
                <li>If possible, exercise with your spouse or a friend. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>c) Oral medication</strong></p>
            <p>When diabetes cannot be controlled by diet and exercise alone, your doctor may prescribe tablets. Medication is not a substitute for an appropriate diet and regular exercise. It is meant to help patients achieve better control of blood glucose after they have tried to do so with appropriate lifestyle modification. </p>
            <p>The tablets are not insulin . Insulin cannot be taken orally it would be destroyed by digestive enzymes. </p>
            <p>The tablets are effective only when the pancreas still produces some insulin. Therefore they are prescribed for people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. </p>
            <p>Medication currently available for the treatment of diabetes mellitus can be divided into 3 broad categories as shown in the table below </p>
