<h2>What Can Be Done?</h2>
<p>Urinary incontinence can be readily treated, improved or cured with behavioural methods, medication or surgery. Management will depend on the types of urinary incontinence.</p>
<p>Behavioural methods are simple and effective ways to control your bladder. You can train your bladder to control the urge for overactive bladder; you can pass urine at certain set times for overflow incontinence, and you can train your pelvic floor muscles for stress incontinence. </p>
<p>Medicines are used to treat urinary infection, vaginal inflammation or to reduce overactivity of bladder muscles. In menopausal women, urinary frequency and urgency can be relieved by local oestrogens.</p>
<p>Surgery is commonly used for female stress urinary incontinence. It is offered after you have failed conservative treatment or you have severe stress urinary incontinence. Your doctor will recommend the appropriate type of surgery. Surgery is also recommended for conditions that cause voiding difficulties such as enlarged and retroverted uterus in women, or pelvic organ prolapse.</p>

<h2>Prevention Of Urinary Incontinence</h2>
<p>You can prevent urinary incontinence by adopting the following good habits:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Drink 6-8 glasses of water daily unless your doctor has instructed otherwise. </li>
    <li>Limit your intake of alcohol and caffeinated drinks. </li>
    <li>Take a balanced diet that includes all food groups and keep within a healthy weight range. </li>
    <li>Include enough fluid and fibre in your diet and exercise regularly to prevent constipation that can lead to poor bladder control. </li>
    <li>Practise good bladder habits by regularly emptying your bladder. Holding back for too long when a bladder is full, or persistently emptying it when it is not, can both cause abnormal bladder function. </li>
    <li>Do pelvic floor exercises regularly to strengthen the muscles supporting the outlet of the bladder. </li>
    <li class=last>Avoid precipitating factors such as obesity, chronic cough, sneezing and heavy lifting etc. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Where To Seek Help?</h2>
<p>Consult your family doctor or visit a urogynaecologist or urologist if you suffer from urinary incontinence. </p>
