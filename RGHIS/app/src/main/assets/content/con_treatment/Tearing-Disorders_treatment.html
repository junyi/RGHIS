<h2>What treatments are there for Tearing Disorders?</h2>
<p>If you have an acute infection of the system, antibiotic treatment with drainage will usually be required. After the infection has cleared, the patient will need definitive surgical repair of the nasolacrimal duct obstruction. The operation required is called Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR), in which a new channel is created to allow tears to drain into the nose again. Specific operations depend on the site of the obstruction. DCR can be done via an external wound or endoscopically as seen in the photo below.</p>
<p>Example :<br>
<table style="width:477px;height:224px">
    <thead>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td> </td>
            <td> No visible external wound.<br>
            <br>
             Stent left in place temporarily to<br>
             improve success rates.</td>

<h2>
<p>Tearing in a newborn baby</p>
</h2>
<p>A newborn baby may present with a 'wet' eye usually at one to two weeks of age. Occasionally, there may be associated mucopurulent discharge. This is usually due to a membrane blocking the drainage of tears into the nose. This blockage usually opens spontaneously within four to six weeks after birth. Massaging the inner corner of the lower eyelid may hasten the opening of the blockage.<br>
 <br>
However, if the tearing persists despite the massage, flushing and probing of the drainage system can be done to perforate the membranous blockage. This is usually done when the child is less than one year of age. The flushing and probing can be repeated if the tearing persists. Persistent tearing despite these measures would require surgical procedures to relieve the obstruction.<br>
