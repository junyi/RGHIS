            <p>If warts are very small and are located only on the skin around the anus, they can be treated with medications, which are applied directly to the surface of the warts. This must be carried out with great care and precision by a doctor to prevent injury to the normal skin surrounding the warts. This method usually requires several treatments performed over several weeks. </p>
            <p>Another form of treatment involves more rapid destruction of the warts using an electrical knife, surgical removal or a combination of the two. Laser surgery may also be used but has no advantage over other treatments. These procedures provide immediate results but must be performed using a local anesthetic or general or spinal anesthetic, depending on the number and exact location of warts being treated.</p>
            <p>Warts inside the anal canal usually are not suitable for treatment by medications, and in most cases need to be treated by cauterisation or surgical removal.</p>
