<h2>What Should I Do If I Have Thalassaemia Minor?</h2>
<p>If you or your partner has thalassaemia minor, both of you should see a doctor for genetic counselling before you plan to get married or have a child. The doctor will explain the risks and discuss the choices you have. He may refer you to the National Thalassaemia Registry for further counselling.</p>
<p>The National Thalassaemia Registry provides genetic counselling for people with thalassaemia and screening for their families. The staff at the Registry will be able to answer your questions about this blood disorder.</p>

<h2>What If I Am Already Pregnant?</h2>
<p>If you are already pregnant and both you and your husband have thalassaemia minor, you should go for a prenatal diagnostic test to find out whether your unborn baby has thalassaemia major.</p>
<p>Prenatal diagnosis can be done by chorionic villus sampling or by fetal blood sampling. Both tests are conducted under ultrasound guidance.</p>
<p>Chorionic villus sampling involves obtaining some cells from the placenta for testing. This is done before 10 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
<p>Fetal blood sampling involves obtaining a small amount of fetal blood from the umbilical cord for testing. This procedure is done at about 18 - 20 weeks of pregnancy.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Based on the result of the test, the doctor will advise you and your husband accordingly.</strong></p>
