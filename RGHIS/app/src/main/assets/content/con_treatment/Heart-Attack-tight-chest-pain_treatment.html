            Treatment for a Heart Attack<a id=Treatment title=Treatment> </a><br>
            </span></h2>
            <p>The goal of treatment of heart attack is early diagnosis and to open up the blocked artery quickly and effectively to minimise the extent of damage to the heart muscle. Currently, there are two treatment options to unblock the artery. The fastest way to treat heart attack is to give a powerful blood thinning medication (thrombolytic agents) to dissolve the clot and therefore unblock the artery. Any qualified physician can give this immediately upon diagnosis of heart attack. However, it is only effective in slightly more than 50% in opening the blocked artery and may cause serious bleeding complications from other areas, including the brain.</p>
            <p>A more effective way to unblock the artery is by inserting a balloon or stent through a small puncture in the groin or wrist to open up the artery, known as coronary angioplasty. It is successful in more than 90% of the cases. The disadvantage of this treatment is that the procedure needs to be performed in the procedure suite and requires experienced operators. There is also a delay in time in getting the whole angioplasty team in the hospital, especially after office hours. At the National Heart Centre Singapore, emergency angioplasty for patients who are admitted for heart attack is available round the clock.</p>

            What to do after a Heart Attack<a class=ms-asset-internalBookmark id="What to do after a Heart Attack" title="What to do after a Heart Attack"> </a><br>
            </span></h2>
            <p>The doctor may recommend a cardiac rehabilitation programme, diet modification and medication to help the patient gradually resume a normal lifestyle and reduce the risk of another heart attack.</p>
            <p><strong>1. Cardiac rehabilitation</strong><br>
            This is a structured programme aimed at helping the patient gradually improve his cardiovascular fitness, and enhance his psychological well-being so as to resume a normal lifestyle. It also aims to modify his risk factors and reduce the risk of another heart attack. </p>
            <p>A team of healthcare professionals including doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, psychologists, dietitians and pharmacists will work closely with the patient. They will be available to teach, guide and encourage the patient on the road to recovery.</p>
            <p>This programme begins in the hospital from the time of diagnosis. It is continued after discharge from hospital, and by the patient eventually. This programme has various components including:<br>
            <br>
            <strong><em>a. Exercise training</em></strong><br>
            A customised exercise programme to safely improve cardiovascular fitness.</p>
            <p><strong><em>b. Health education</em></strong><br>
            To provide the patient and family members with information on heart attack, its signs and symptoms and its risk factors.</p>
            <p><strong><em>c. Risk factor and behaviour modification</em></strong><br>
            Practical steps in risk factor and behaviour modification will be taught. People who smoke are strongly encouraged to stop and given advice on how to do so. Stress management is also important.</p>
            <p><strong><em>d. Dietary modification</em></strong><br>
            The patient will be advised to adopt a healthy diet. For instance, food high in cholesterol and saturated fats such as animal fats, whole milk products, eggs, red meats (beef, lamb), coconut oil and palm oil are to be avoided. Healthy alternative foods will be introduced, for example, low fat milk or lean meats. Healthy food preparation alternatives will be introduced to the patient or family members. For example, the use of canola or olive oil for cooking, baking, boiling or steaming food instead of frying.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Medicines</strong><br>
            Medicine will be prescribed to a heart attack patient to:<br>
            - Reduce the risk of another heart attack (such as anti-platelet medication like aspirin, clopidogrel or ticlopidine).<br>
            - Relieve chest pain.<br>
            - Control risk factors like diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol. </p>
            <p>The patient should follow the medication regimen as prescribed even if he feels well. He should tell the doctor if he has any side effects from the medication. The patient should also tell the doctor if he finds the dosing inconvenient or if he finds it difficult to take his medication regularly.</p>

            When can a heart attack patient return to normal activities<a class=ms-asset-internalBookmark id="When can a heart attack patient return to normal activities" title="When can a heart attack patient return to normal activities"> </a><br>
            </span></h2>
            <p>Every patient is different and should consult their doctor on when to resume various activities. Here is some general advice which applies to patient with uncomplicated heart attacks.</p>
            <p><strong>1. Work<br>
            </strong>This depends on the nature of a patientв„ўs work. If the work is not physically demanding, the patient can resume work in a few weeks. For a physically demanding or stressful job, the patient may need up to three months away from work. The patient should consult his/her cardiologist regarding specific fitness for resuming work.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Driving</strong><br>
            The patient should consult with his/her <strong>cardiologist</strong> regarding specific fitness for driving, especially if one drives commercial vehicles.</p>
            <p>Many patients will be able to drive within three to five week after the heart attack if they recover well with no complications. However it is best for someone to accompany the patient initially.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Sports</strong><br>
            After a heart attack, a patient is advised to have adequate rest. The road to recovery of cardiovascular fitness is gradual. The intensity of exercise should be gradually increased.</p>
            <p>The patient may start exercise walking on flat ground in the third week after the heart attack, may start climbing and gentle uphill walking from the fourth week. Normal brisk walking can usually resume in about three months.<br>
            <br>
            If a patient experiences chest pain, discomfort or shortness of breath while walking, slow down and stop. Report the symptoms to the doctor. The patient should consult his/her cardiologist regarding the specific time frame for resuming normal sporting activities.</p>
