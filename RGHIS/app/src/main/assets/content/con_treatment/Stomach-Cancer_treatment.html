            Causes and Risks</span></h2>
            <p>Patients with stomach cancer have a higher rate of infection with a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori. However, the vast majority of people who have this bacterium in their stomachs do not develop stomach cancer.</p>
            <p>An increased risk of stomach cancer is associated with diets containing large amounts of smoked foods, salted fish and meat, and pickled foods. On the other hand, eating fruits and vegetables high in Vitamin A and C appear to lower the risk of stomach cancer.</p>
            <p>Nitrites and nitrates are substances commonly found in cured meats. These can be converted by some bacteria into compounds which can cause cancer in animals. This has not been proven in humans.</p>

            Treatment Options</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Treatment of Stomach Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            <strong>Surgery</strong> is the only effective curative method in the treatment of stomach cancer. Even in certain patients with advanced stomach cancer, surgery is performed to reduce complications of the cancer such as blockage of the stomach or bleeding from the cancer.</p>
            <p><strong>Radiotherapy</strong> is useful for relieving stomach obstruction in patients with advanced stomach cancer. Radiotherapy may also be used to stop bleeding from cancers that cannot be operated on. It is given over 5 minutes every day for 2 to 5 weeks. There may be temporary loss of appetite, nausea, and pain in the radiated site.</p>
            <p><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> is sometimes used to reduce symptoms from an advanced cancer or to prolong the time to growth of the cancer. Many chemotherapy drugs are available, most of them with side effects such as temporary nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and lowering of the white blood counts. Alternatively, clinical trials with novel drugs are usually available as an option for patients. </p>
            <p>For resected stomach cancers, chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy is given to reduce the chance of cancer recurrence and to improve the chance of surviving the cancer. </p>
            <p><strong>Prognosis of Stomach Cancer<br>
            </strong><br>
            Patients with operated stomach cancer without lymph node involvement have a more than 50% chance of being cured from cancer after surgery. However, if the cancer spreads through the wall of the stomach to involve the normal fat around the stomach, the chance of cure decreases. Once lymph nodes surrounding the stomach are involved by the cancer, even after surgical removal of all cancer, only about 15 to 20% of patients will be alive without cancer at 5 years.</p>

            Frequently Asked Questions </span></h2>
            <p><strong>A few of my blood relatives have stomach cancer. Am I at higher risk?<br>
            </strong><br>
            People with a family history of stomach cancer have a slightly higher risk of developing stomach cancer. It is recommended that you mention your family history of stomach cancer to your physician everytime you seek a medical opinion.</p>
            <p><strong>I have a blood relative with colon cancer. Do I stand a higher risk of stomach cancer?<br>
            </strong><br>
            A hereditary condition, known as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), predisposes a person to colon cancer. People with FAP also stand a slightly higher chance of stomach cancer.</p>
            <p><strong>I get gastric pain very often. Should I go for screening for stomach cancer?<br>
            </strong><br>
            Persistent gastric pain should be investigated further especially if there is associated weight loss, anaemia or lack of red blood cells, presence of blood in the faeces, or family history of stomach or colon cancer.</p>
