            <p>There are a few effective treatments for obstructive sleep apnoea, namely weight loss, breathing-assistance devices, dental appliances and surgery. A commonly recommended treatment involves using a breathing-assistance device known as the CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) device, during sleep. This device delivers air under pressure to the airway through a mask applied over the nose (held down by straps). This pressure that is applied keeps your airway from collapsing during sleep. It is probably the most effective form of treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea at present.</p>
            <p>Surgery is effective in a select group of patients and usually involves procedures that trim excess soft tissue from the upper part of the throat ( uvulopharyngeopalatoplasty) and may involve moving the base of the tongue forward and anchoring it to the base of your chin (genioglossus advancement).</p>
            <p>Specially-cast dental appliances ( something like braces) can also be worn at night to treat obstructive sleep apnea.</p>
