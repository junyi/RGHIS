<h2>Is Bedwetting A Problem That Needs Therapy?</h2>
<p>Yes, especially when the child is already at school going age and the wetting is frequent.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Studies have shown that constant bedwetting can adversely affect the psychosocial development of the child causing low self-esteem and poor social adjustment </li>
    <li>It can also cause resentment and anxiety in parents and other family members </li>
    <li class=last>It constitutes a source of embarrassment and deters the sufferer from healthy outdoor activities like overnight camping and travelling </li>
</ul>
<p>In Singapore, it has been found that bedwetters and their parents sought treatment for the following reasons : </p>
<ul>
    <li>Restricted activities involving overnight sleep outside home </li>
    <li>Parental fatigue </li>
    <li>Disrupted sleep for the household </li>
    <li class=last>Fear of underlying disease </li>
</ul>
<h2>How Common Is Bedwetting?</h2>
<p>Actual incidence of bedwetting is unknown in Singapore. However, it is believed to be quite common and there is an increasing number of cases seeking treatment in recent years.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Its occurrence in Singapore might be under-reported as it had been found that many sufferers and parents were too embarrassed to seek treatment while others thought that there is no effective treatment; thereby suffering in silence </li>
    <li class=last>In Western countries, the problem is common with a reported incidence of 10% among 7-year-olds, 5% among 10-year-olds and 1% in the adult population </li>
</ul>

<h2>What Causes Bedwetting?</h2>
<p>The exact cause or causes are unknown. Various factors or causes that have been implicated include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hereditary cause. Bedwetting often runs in a family. </li>
    <li>Inability to wake up to void urine. Bedwetters are known to be deep sleepers. </li>
    <li>A delay in maturation of bladder control at night. Bedwetting tends to improve with time and the majority of sufferers will ultimately become dry. But this may take years and a small percentage of them (1%) will continue bedwetting beyond puberty. </li>
    <li class=last>Lack of the production of a naturally occurring body hormone called Anti-Diuretic Hormone (ADH) during sleep in 20-30% of children with bedwetting. This hormone is important for reducing urine production at night. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Is Bedwetting Due To Psychological Problems?</h2>
<p><strong>No. </strong></p>
<ul></ul>
    <li>Bedwetting is involuntary and the child is actually helpless and has no control over wetting </li>
    <li class=last>In fact, punishing or blaming a child for bedwetting may actually lead to psychological problems in a child
