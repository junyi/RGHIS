<h2>
<p>What kinds of treatments are available for Glaucoma?</p>
</h2>
Glaucoma cannot be cured, but it can be successfully controlled in most cases. Treatment depends on the type and severity of glaucoma and it may be in the form of medication, laser therapy or surgery.
<p>Our Glaucoma Consultants at SNEC perform various glaucoma surgeries for both paediatric and adult patients.  The glaucoma surgeries include:</p>
<p>▶ Goniotomy<br>
▶ Trabeculectomy with anti-metabolites<br>
▶ Combined Trabeculectomy (with anti-metabolites) and Cataract surgery<br>
▶ Glaucoma Drainage Devices such as the Ahmed and Baerveldt tubes as well as novel devices such <br>
   as the ExPRESS mini shunt.<br>
▶ Goniosynechiolysis</p>
<p>Your doctor will determine the most appropriate individualised treatment for you after a detailed clinical evaluation.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Clinical Outcomes</h2>
<p>The Glaucoma Service at SNEC conducts an independent surgical audit annually. The success rate of a surgical procedure is evaluated and defined as an achievement of an intraocular pressure of less than or equal to 21mmHg at the end of the first postoperative year.  In the 2010 surgical audit, the overall success rate of a trabeculectomy surgery in primary glaucoma was 98.8%, while that of an aqueous shunt surgery was 94.6%.  The overall success rate for a combined trabeculectomy and cataract surgery was 98.5%.  Our surgical results are in keeping with all established international indicators for surgical success, reflecting our delivery of world-class glaucoma care.   </p>
