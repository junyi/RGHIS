            <p><strong>Treatment for Parkinsonв„ўs Disease<br>
            </strong><br>
            Parkinsonв„ўs disease is a slowly progressive disorder. There is currently no cure. However, there are effective medications that can improve the symptoms of the disease. Your doctor will be able to recommend the most appropriate medications depending on your symptoms, age and other medical conditions. Treatment has to be individualised and medications that are suitable for one patient may not be ideal for another. For patients with more advanced disease, limited neurosurgery called Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) may further improve symptoms. This involves the implantation of a wire into the brain to electrically stimulate that area.</p>
            <p><strong>Treatment for Movement Disorders <br>
            </strong><br>
            After the type of abnormal movement has been classified and the cause established, the next step is to reduce the frequency or severity of these movements so as to improve function or reduce discomfort. Oral medications are the main type of treatment used to control these movements. For some of these disorders such as facial spasms or dystonia, botulinum toxin injections may be useful to relieve the symptoms.</p>
            <p><strong>Research<br>
            </strong><br>
            Research is a major emphasis of this programme at the . Both patient-based and laboratory-based research are conducted at the Institute under strict ethical guidelines. Doctors and scientists work together closely to understand the causes and find better means to treat patients with Parkinsonв„ўs disease and other movement disorders. Patients who are interested to participate in these research initiatives are encouraged to approach their treating doctors.</p>
            <p><strong>Community Care Partners Programme (CCPP)<br>
            </strong><br>
            In October 2007, our Parkinsonв„ўs Disease and Movement Disorders Centre initiated Singaporeв„ўs first-ever organised outreach programme for the Parkinson community. The NNI-CCPP is a programme that aims to enhance the delivery of community care and support to the Parkinson community by tapping on the well-integrated network of community healthcare facilities in Singapore. The NNI and its CCPP partners work together to ensure that the PD community receives the best possible coordinated care. Our CCPP Partners help provide the crucial link between NNI and the dependent PD patients in the community. For more information on CCPP and the list of our partners, please visit our website at www.nni.com.sg.</p>
            <p><strong>NNI Parkinsonв„ўs Disease and Movement Disorders Centre <br>
            </strong><br>
            The Parkinsonв„ўs Disease and Movement Disorders Centre at the National Neuroscience Institute (PDMDC NNI) is dedicated to the comprehensive care, research, education and training into Parkinsonв„ўs disease and movement disorders. We have a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals and research scientists, through a unique partnership between NNI and two major hospitals in Singapore: Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and . Since 2006, our Centre was designated as a National Parkinson Foundation (NPF) Centre of Excellence. This is a designation awarded by the National Parkinson Foundation (www.parkinson.org) to healthcare institutions that excel in Parkinson-related comprehensive care, research and community outreach programmes. We are proud to be one of the two NPF Centres of Excellence in Asia.</p>
