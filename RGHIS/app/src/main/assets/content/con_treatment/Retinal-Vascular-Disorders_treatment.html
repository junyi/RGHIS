<h2>What treatments are available for Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)?<br>
 </h2>
Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO) is treated in two stages. The first is the rapid diagnosis and treatment of the vision loss by lowering the eye pressure with ocular massage, anterior chamber paracentesis and medication. The second stage is to find out the root cause for the condition. Prompt treatment improves the chance of recovering vision, but outcomes remain poor, with only one in four patients able to retain useful vision. This means the management of risk factors and regular eye examinations are extremely important in preventing this condition from occurring.<br>
