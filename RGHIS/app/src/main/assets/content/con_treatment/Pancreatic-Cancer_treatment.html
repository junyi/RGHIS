            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Diagnostic Tests</strong><br>
            <br>
            The signs and symptoms of the disease are non-specific. If pancreatic cancer is suspected, the initial diagnostic test would be a CT or computerised scan of the abdomen. The CT scan is able to detect any pancreatic mass greater than 2cm 95% of the time. Smaller cancers are more difficult to detect. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can visualise the pancreas and the ducts in the pancreas. This can be particularly useful when planning surgery.</p>
            <p>Another procedure that is often done is an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) which involves using a fiberoptic scope to look into the stomach and small intestine where the ducts of the pancreas drain into. X-ray dye is then injected into the ducts of the pancreas and x-rays taken of the pancreas. </p>
            <p>Irregularities of the pancreatic ducts can then be visualised. Small pieces of tissue can also be biopsied during this procedure. If a blockage of the ducts is seen, a small plastic tube, called a stent, can be placed during this same procedure to try and bypass the block. Potential complications of this procedure include infection of the pancreas and perforation of the small intestine. A stent which is placed will need to be changed 3 to 4 monthly because the stent can be blocked by normal secretions from the pancreas. </p>
            <p>Sometimes, when a biopsy cannot be obtained via ERCP, a percutaneous biopsy of the pancreatic lesion is performed to obtain tumour tissue for diagnosis. This involves inserting a needle through the abdominal wall to the pancreas under CT or ultrasound imaging guidance. </p>

            Treatment Options</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Treatment of Pancreas Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            Surgery continues to be the treatment of choice for pancreatic cancer. Unfortunately, most patients are not candidates for curative surgery because of the advanced stage of disease when diagnosed. Even if curative surgery is not possible, bypass procedures performed during the time of surgery to relieve the jaundice and itching associated with pancreatic cancer can do much to improve the patient's quality of life. Radiotherapy may be considered as primary treatment if surgery is not possible. In this situation, radiotherapy can relieve pain and occasionally jaundice. </p>
            <p>Radiotherapy may be considered as primary treatment if surgery is not possible. In this situation, radiotherapy can relieve pain and occasionally jaundice. Radiotherapy may also be considered as an additional treatment after curative surgery to try and prevent cancer recurrence.</p>
            <p>Chemotherapy is used either to make radiotherapy more effective, i.e. as a radiosensitiser or when pancreatic cancer is very advanced i.e. surgery and radiotherapy are not being considered at all. Chemotherapy may prolong a patient's life by a few months. More important, chemotherapy has been shown to relieve pain in some patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.</p>
            <p><strong>Prognosis of Pancreas Cancer<br>
            </strong><br>
            Even with curative surgery, about half of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma survive between 2 to 3 years. The chance of surviving to 5 years after curative surgery is about 20%. For patients with advanced inoperable pancreatic cancer, most patients do not live beyond a year. </p>
