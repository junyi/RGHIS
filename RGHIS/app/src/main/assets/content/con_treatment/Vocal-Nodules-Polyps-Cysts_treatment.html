            Treatment</span></h2>
            <p>Treatment includes voice rest, management of aggravating factors (e.g. acid reflux and allergic rhinitis), and sometimes voice therapy with a speech therapist. Many benign vocal fold growths resolve with conservative management. If the growth persists or there is doubt about its nature, then phono-microsurgery may be advocated. <br>
            <br>
            Phono-microsurgery is surgery to the vocal fold using microsurgical techniques and instruments, and sometimes lasers. This surgery may be recommended to improve the voice or remove a growth for laboratory analysis. If a lesion proves to be cancerous, further treatment will be required.</p>
