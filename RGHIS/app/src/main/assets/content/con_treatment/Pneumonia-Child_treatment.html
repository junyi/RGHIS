<h2>Discharge Instructions For Home Treatment</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Antibiotics:</strong> You must complete the course of antibiotics as prescribed by your doctor. </li>
    <li><strong>Medicines for fever:</strong> Use paracetamol or ibuprofen for fever (&gt;37.5 В°C). This can be repeated every 6 hours. If the fever is 39.5 В°C or more, you may use the paracetamol every 4 hourly, but only for 1 to 2 days, and subsequently reduced to every 6 hourly. Overdose of paracetamol may lead to liver damage. </li>
    <li><strong>Warm fluids for coughing spasms</strong>: Coughing spasms are often caused by sticky secretions in the back of the throat. Warm fluids usually relax the airway and loosen the secretions. </li>
    <li class=last><strong>Follow-Up Appointments:</strong> Your child needs to be reviewed by a doctor either at the specialist clinic or by a general practitioner. Keep the appointment as given by your attending doctor. </li>
</ol>
