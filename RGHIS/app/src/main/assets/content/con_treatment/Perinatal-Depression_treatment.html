<h2>What Can Be Done to Help You if You Suffer from Antenatal Depression</h2>
<p>If you are pregnant and depressed, you may hesitate to get help for depression because of the fear of what others might think and the concern about the medications prescribed. </p>
<p>However, the management of antenatal depression involves looking at the stresses and causative factors, counselling, gathering support for you, and other forms of psychological therapy. Only when the depression is severe, will medication be recommended. Furthermore, there are certain medications that are compatible with pregnancy, and are safe for both the mother and growing fetus. </p>
<p>If depression is left untreated, it will worsen and lead to adverse effects for you and your baby. </p>
<p>The first trimester is often a difficult period with uncomfortable symptoms of morning sickness and tiredness. The early hormonal changes during this stage may also contribute to depression. However, antidepressants should be avoided at this stage, as this is the time that the babyв„ўs organs are developing. During this time, gathering assistance such as arranging for the family to help with the care of the older child, or household chores will be helpful. This will allow the woman to have much needed rest. Therapy and counselling are often beneficial too, as they will enable you to talk about your stresses and work through any difficult emotional conflicts. </p>
<p>In the second trimester, antidepressant use may be considered if the depression is at least of moderate severity, and is not improving with non-pharmacological methods. </p>
<p>During the last few weeks of pregnancy, it is recommended that antidepressants be gradually tailed off. This is because some medications may cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn.</p>
<p>However, if you suffer from a pre-existing depressive illness that is severe, and require long-term antidepressant maintenance, the risk-considerations may sometimes necessitate that you remain on antidepressant medication throughout pregnancy. Risks will be kept minimal by using minimal possible dose, keeping you under close supervision, as well as utilising all other treatment modalities that are appropriate for you. </p>
<p><strong>Case Example<br>
</strong>Agnes was a 34 year-old mother, who experienced mood swings, loss of appetite and interests and was unable to concentrate at work. She also had excessive self-blame, but did not have any suicidal feelings. The main stressor she experienced was her breech pregnancy, and her worries of the outcome. This was also a long awaited pregnancy, which was precious ' the couple had been married for six years, and she had had one previous miscarriage.</p>
<p>As she was already in her third trimester, her doctor did not prescribe her medication as it could affect the baby. She received supportive therapy, and her husband was encouraged to spend time with her. Her in-laws, who had mistakenly believed that she was somehow responsible for the complicated pregnancy, were also advised and educated on the nature of breech pregnancy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she had an uneventful delivery by Caesarean operation, and delivered a healthy baby girl.</p>
<h2>Postpartum Depression</h2>
<p>When the baby comes, your family and friend will tend to expect you, the mother, to be happy and perfectly at peace with the arrival of the new addition. Also, whilst others will shower special attention and care during pregnancy, oftentimes the focus is on the newborn after delivery, and the mother sometimes is just relegated to being seen as the milking machine or the nappy changer. </p>
<p>The pressure you have can then become immense. Your needs no longer seem important, whereas the needs of your baby come first. If there is inadequate support and help, especially from your husband, it may be even harder for you to adjust to the changes. Added to that, the lack of sleep in the initial weeks, and the hormonal changes can all be overwhelming.</p>
<p>The common postnatal depressive syndromes that can affect you include postnatal blues, postnatal depression and postnatal psychotic depression. You should note that postnatal blues are not strictly considered an per se, and may in fact be a normal emotional change during a period of transition. But as it is often confused with postnatal depression, we shall try to explain more here.</p>
<h2>Postnatal Blues</h2>
<p>As common as occurring in two-thirds of women, the blues hit in the first week after delivery, and are usually short lasting, and can be resolved spontaneously within a few days to weeks.</p>
<h2>Symptoms of postnatal blues:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>feelings of irritability </li>
    <li>weepiness </li>
    <li>moodiness </li>
    <li>anxious thoughts about caring for the baby </li>
