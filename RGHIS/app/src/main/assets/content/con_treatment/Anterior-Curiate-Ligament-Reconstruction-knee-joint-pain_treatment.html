            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
            Day of Surgery</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Before you go for your operation</strong><br>
            It is advisable for you to take a good shower, brush your teeth and rinse your mouth. You should refrain from drinking anything on the morning of your surgery. However, if you have to take medication for your medical problem, the nurse will advise you to take it with sips of water.</p>
            <p>Shortly before the estimated time of your operation, the nurse will inform you to do the following: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Empty your bladder </li>
                <li>Remove any dentures, spectacles and contact lenses, make-up, nail polish, hairpiece, jewellery and prosthesis </li>
                <li>Change into a gown </li>
            </ul>
            Please inform your nurse if you have any personal items requiring safekeeping.
            <p><strong>Pre-medication</strong><br>
            You may be given medication in the form of tablets or an injection to help you relax. This medication will make you sleepy, and may cause dryness in your mouth. </p>
            <p>You should not attempt to get out of bed after taking the medication. Our nurse or health attendant will transfer you to the operating theatre on a trolley.</p>
            <p><strong>Family Room</strong><br>
            Your family members could either return to the ward or wait in the waiting area just outside the operating theatre. Please advise them not to wait along the corridor. </p>
            <p><strong>In the Operating Theatre</strong><br>
            Once you have arrived at the operating theatre, the nurse there will verify your identity and also the type of surgery you are scheduled for. </p>
            <p>After verification, you will be transferred to another trolley and wheeled into the induction room to meet the anaesthetist and the surgeon.</p>
            <p>The anaesthetist will give you an injection to put you in a deep sleep, so that you will not feel any pain. The operation is done under general anaesthesia. </p>

            After Surgery</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Recovery Room</strong><br>
            After your operation, you will be taken directly to the recovery room. Your blood pressure, breathing and heart rate will be checked frequently.</p>
            <p>Please inform the nurse if you are feeling nauseous or experiencing any pain, so that medication could be given to relieve your discomfort.</p>
            <p>When you are awake and your blood pressure and pulse have stabilised, you will be transferred to the ward. </p>

            Medical and Nursing Care in the Inpatient Care Units</span></h2>
            <p>At the ward, the nurses will check your blood pressure and pulse closely for the first few hours.</p>
            <p><strong>Relief of Post-Surgery Discomfort</strong><br>
            Some level of discomfort is to be expected after the surgery. You will be given medications to help relieve any pain, as well as to help you recover from the operation. </p>
            <p><strong>Diet</strong><br>
            Drinks will be served when you have recovered from the effects of the anaesthesia. You will be able to resume your normal diet subsequently if there is no complaint of nausea or vomiting. </p>
            <p><strong>Wound Care</strong> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your operated leg will be bandaged and elevated. You may find a drainage tube inserted in your knee to drain out the excess blood from the surgery. The tube will be removed upon instruction from your surgeon. </li>
                <li>An ice wrap (Duracold) will be placed on your knee for the next 24 to 72 hours, as instructed by your doctor. This is to reduce the pain and swelling on the operated site. During the first week, keep the leg elevated. You can also use ice wraps to help reduce the swelling and pain around the knee. </li>
                <li>Your knee will also be put on a brace, to protect your new ACL. The physiotherapist or surgeon may 'lock' or 'unlock' the knee brace. You are advised not to remove or adjust the brace without instructions from the surgeon or physiotherapist. </li>
                <li>You may experience some itchiness with the brace on at all times. It is recommended that you wear stocking on the leg to absorb any perspiration. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Elimination Needs</strong><br>
            As you need to rest in bed for at least a day, you will require a bedpan or urinal for elimination purposes.</p>
            <p><strong>Rehabilitation after Surgery</strong><br>
            You will be taught some exercises and how to manage your brace after surgery.</p>
            <p>Your surgeon and physiotherapist will discuss with you the rehabilitation plan, as you may or may not be allowed to bear weight on your operated knee. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>As instructed by your physiotherapist, you should start gentle hip and knee bending exercises, within limits of your pain. <br>
                 </li>
                <li>You will be taught how to lift your operated leg while maintaining a straight knee. Your may be required to keep the brace on while doing your exercise. <br>
                 </li>
                <li>Your physiotherapist will teach you how to walk and climb the stairs using a pair of crutches. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Length of Stay</strong><br>
            The average length of stay for patients undergoing surgery for ACL reconstruction is two to three days. However, the length of stay may vary with each individual.</p>
