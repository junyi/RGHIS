            <p><strong>Treatment of Kidney Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            <strong>Surgery</strong> Surgery is the recommended treatment for early stage kidney cancer. Removal of the kidney is called nephrectomy. A person can live a normal lifespan with only one kidney if the other kidney is normal. Some patients with symptoms of pain and bleeding with minimal cancer spread elsewhere can also be offered surgery.</p>
            <p>Sometimes <strong>radiation therapy</strong> is given. High-energy rays are focused onto the kidney cancer to relieve pain when the cancer is advanced and cannot be removed surgically. Another use for radiotherapy to the kidney cancer is to stop bleeding from the cancer. Systemic therapies, which comprise of targeted therapy and immunotherapy1, are used in advanced kidney cancer. It is not a cure but can prolong the life of the individual. There are an increasing number of new targeted therapies that have been developed in this setting<sup>2,3</sup>. </p>
            <p><strong>Prognosis of Kidney Cancer<br>
            </strong><br>
            Clinical examinations scans and pathology reports all help the medical team decide what the progress of kidney cancer is. The appropriate course of treatment may then be recommended. The treatment strategy will vary from person to person. Prognosis of kidney cancer depends on the extent of the disease (stage), the state of health of the individual as well as response to treatment. </p>
