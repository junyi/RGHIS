                        <p>The mainstay of treatment for coronary artery disease remains medication. Some patients will require invasive intervention such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). <br>
                        <br>
                        During CABG, a new graft vessel which is a healthy artery or vein taken from the patientв„ўs leg, arm or chest, is surgically removed and sewn around the areas of the blockage. The graft vessel supplies oxygenated blood to the part of the heart that needs it, thereby 'bypassing' the blocked arteries and restoring blood flow to the heart muscle. Augmented blood flow improves symptom, reduce the need for medication, and prolongs life in well-selected patients.</p>
