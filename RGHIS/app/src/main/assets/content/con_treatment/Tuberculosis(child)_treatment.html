            Treatment Options</span></h2>
            <p>Latent TB Infection usually requires the patient to take 1 to 2 types of medications for up to 9 months to control the bacteria. You need to take the medicine to prevent getting active TB Disease.</p>
            <p>Active TB Disease will require the patient to take 3 or more medications for at least 6 months depending on the type and severity of TB Disease. The treatment is very effective in curing TB as long as your child takes the medication. You need to ensure your child swallows the medicines and completes the whole course. Even if your child feels better, he/she will need to stay on the medicine to be fully cured. Any interruptions in treatment may need the whole course to be restarted depending on when and how long the interruption was. TB germs die very slowly and the treatment takes months to be effective. Taking your medications according to the way you are supposed to, is the only way to ensure your TB is cured</p>

            </span><br>
            While side effects due to the medications can occur, they are uncommon in adults and much less common in children. These mainly arise due to liver inflammation, and are reversible upon stopping the medications. Do feel free to discuss with your doctor if you have any concern with your childв„ўs medications. The good news is that most people can take their TB medicines without any problems.</p>
            <p>One other common reaction for patients on rifampicin is having reddish-orange discolouration of urine, faeces and tears which is normally expected. </p>
