            <br>
            Hip OA cannot be cured, but therapies are available to relieve discomfort and to control the degeneration of the joint. <br>
            <br>
            Your doctor may prescribe medicine to help control your pain. Physical therapy plays a critical role in the nonsurgical management of hip OA. A primary goal is to help you learn how to control symptoms and maximise the function of your hip. You will learn ways to calm pain and symptoms, which might include the use of rest, massage and heat therapy. A walking stick or walking frame may be needed to reduce pressure on the hip when walking. Range of motion and stretching exercises will be used to improve hip motion. You will be shown strengthening exercises for the hip to steady the joint and protect it from further injury. Your therapist can suggest tips for getting your tasks done with less strain on the joint.</p>
