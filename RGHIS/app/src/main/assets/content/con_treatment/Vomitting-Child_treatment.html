<h2>Home Care For Vomiting</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Offer small amounts of clear fluid for 8 hours (no solid food):</strong> Offer clear fluids in small amounts until 8 hours have passed without vomiting. You can offer glucose water, barley, rice water or oral re-hydration solution such as Pedialyte. Avoid giving just plain water alone. Start with 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon of the clear fluid, depending on your child's age, every 5 minutes (or 15 to 30 ml every 15 minutes). After 4 hours without vomiting, double the amount each hour. If your child vomits using this treatment, rest the stomach complete for 1 hour and then start over but with a smaller amount. </li>
    <li><strong>Offer bland foods after 8 hours without vomiting:</strong> For older children, they can start on porridge, bread, biscuits, bland soups or mashed potatoes. For infants, they can start on milk feeds, but give 1 or 2 ounces less per feed than usual. Usually, your child can be back on a normal diet within 24 hours after recovery from vomiting. </li>
    <li><strong>Diet for breast-fed babies:</strong> Provide breast milk in smaller amounts than usual. Nurse on only 1 side for 5 minutes every 30 to 60 minutes. If there is no more vomiting for 8 hours, return to normal nursing on both sides. </li>
</ol>
