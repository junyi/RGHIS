            <p>Treatment for coronary artery disease is dependent on the extent of the disease and the symptoms experienced by the patient.</p>
            <p><strong>1) Lifestyle changes</strong></p>
            <p>Eating a healthy and balanced diet, with more vegetables or fruits, is important in protecting our heart arteries. Food that are rich in fats, particularly saturated fats, can lead to a higher level of cholesterol, which is a major component of the deposits that contribute to the narrowing of heart arteries.</p>
            <p>Regular exercise plays a vital role in keeping the heart healthy. Exercise helps us to become fitter and build a stronger circulatory system. It also helps us to lose weight. Obesity is unhealthy, as it leads to a higher incidence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and high lipid levels, all of which can damage the heart arteries.</p>
            <p><strong>2) Controlling major risk factors of coronary artery disease</strong></p>
            <p>Diabetes mellitus, smoking, high cholesterol level, and high blood pressure are four major factors that lead to higher risk of coronary artery disease.</p>
            <p>Good control of these four major risk factors through lifestyle changes and/or medication can help to stabilise the progress of atherosclerosis, and reduce the risk of complications such as heart attack.</p>
            <p><strong>3) Medical therapy</strong></p>
            <p>Various medications are helpful for patients with coronary artery disease. Among the common ones are:</p>
            <p><strong><em>- Aspirin / Clopidogrel / Ticlopidine</em></strong><br>
            These medications thin the blood and reduce the likelihood for a blood clot to form on top of the narrowed heart arteries, therefore reducing the risk of a heart attack.</p>
            <p><em><strong>- Beta-blockers (e.g. Atenolol, Bisoprolol, Carvedilol)</strong></em><br>
            These medications help to reduce the heart rate and blood pressure, thus reducing the symptoms of angina as well as protect the heart.</p>
            <p><strong><em>- Nitrates (e.g. Isosorbide Dinitrate)</em></strong><br>
            These medications work by opening the heart arteries, and therefore improving the blood flow to the heart muscle and reducing symptoms of chest pain. A short-acting form of nitrates, Glyceryl Trinitrate, usually given as tablets or a spray to be administered under the tongue, is commonly used for immediate relief of chest pain.</p>
            <p><strong><em>- Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (e.g. Enalapril, Perindopril) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (e.g. Losartan, Valsartan)</em></strong><br>
            These medications allow the blood to flow from the heart more easily, and also help to lower the blood pressure.</p>
            <p><strong><em>- Lipid-lowering medications (e.g. Fenofibrate, Simvastatin, Atorvastatin, Rosuvastatin)</em></strong><br>
            These medications lower the levels of
