            <p>If you have had a deep vein clot before, future clots may be prevented by:<br>
            - Taking the medicines prescribed by your doctor to prevent or treat blood clots<br>
            - Following up with your doctor for medicine changes and blood tests<br>
            <br>
            When travelling by air, bus or train, walk up and down the aisle every couple of hours. <br>
            <br>
            When sitting, exercise your calf muscles by pulling your toes toward your knees several times every hour. <br>
            <br>
            Consider wearing compression stockings. <br>
            <br>
            Stay hydrated by drinking water (avoid caffeine and alcohol) and wear loose-fitting clothes. <br>
            <br>
            After a surgery or illness, try to get out of bed and move around as soon as you are advised to do so by your doctor. Take medicine to prevent blood clots as directed by your doctor after surgery.</p>
