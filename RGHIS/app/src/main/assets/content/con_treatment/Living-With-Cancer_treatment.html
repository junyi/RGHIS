<h2>Treatment Of Cancer Recurrence</h2>
<p>The treatment that is recommended by your doctor for cancer recurrence depends on the type of cancer, its size and location, your general health, and other treatments you have already had for the original cancer.</p>
<p>It is very important that you ask your doctor about the treatment. You need to understand why one treatment is being recommended over others. You need to understand the benefits, risks, side effects, cost of treatment, and the possible impact of the recommended treatment on your quality of life.</p>
<p>These are some of the questions you may wish to ask your doctor about treatment.If you obtain answers to these questions, you and your doctor will be able to make the best possible decision about which treatment is best for you.</p>
<ul>
    <li>What are you hoping that this treatment will do for me? Will it cure me, will it shrink the tumour or will it just relieve my symptoms? </li>
    <li>Why do you think that this treatment is the best for me? Are there other possible treatments? What are they? </li>
    <li>What are the side effects of this treatment? Are they temporary or are they permanent? </li>
    <li>How will I know that this treatment is working? </li>
    <li>Will I need to stay in hospital? </li>
    <li>How much will this treatment cost? </li>
    <li>How long will I be on this treatment? </li>
    <li class=last>What will happen if I do not have this treatment? </li>
</ul>
<h2>What If I Have Pain?</h2>
<p>Not everyone with cancer has pain. However, pain can occur at any stage of the disease. It is important to remember that, if there is pain, there are many ways to relieve it. </p>
<p>Cancer pain usually occurs because the growing tumour presses on the surrounding tissues. Therefore, if the cancer is causing your pain, your doctor may recommend surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy to remove or shrink the tumour.</p>
<p>You may also need pain medication to relieve the pain. There are many different types of pain medication. Different pains require different types of medicine. This is why your doctor will often prescribe a combination of medicines for your pain. </p>
<p>Most pain can be controlled with medicines that are taken by mouth. Medications like paracetamol (Panadol), non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen (Synflex) and opioids such as codeine or morphine are commonly used. </p>
<p>However it is not always necessary to take pain medications by mouth or by injection. Fentanyl, a strong pain medicine which should only be used if prescribed by your doctor, is available in a small adhesive patch, which is placed on the skin. The medicine is absorbed through the skin. The patch is replaced every third day. </p>
<p>Sometimes medications that are normally used for other conditions, are used to treat pain. For example, anti-depressant medications or anti-epileptic medications can also help nerve pain that has tingling, burning or shooting quality. If your doctor prescribes these medications, it does not mean that you are depressed or likely to have epileptic fits. </p>
<p>Pain medicine works best if taken before the pain becomes severe. This is why your doctor will recommend that you take your medicine at regular intervals, not just when the pain returns.</p>
<p>Your doctor needs to know as much about your pain as possible. These are some of the questions you will be asked about your pain:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Where exactly is your pain? Does it move from one place to another? Have you more than one pain? </li>
    <li>How does the pain feel? Is it dull, sharp, aching, burning? Try to describe the pain as clearly as possible. </li>
    <li>How often does the pain occur? What seems to make the pain start? Is the pain related to specific activities such as eating, walking, passing motion? </li>
    <li>How long does the pain last? </li>
    <li>Does anything seem to make the pain better? </li>
    <li class=last>What medication have you already used for this pain? Did it help? </li>
</ul>
<h2>What About Morphine?</h2>
<p>Morphine is made from the sap of the poppy plant and is a very effective pain medicine for severe pain. Morphine belongs to a group of medicines called opioids that work on nerve cells in the spinal cord and in the brain to decreased the sensation of pain.</p>
<p>Morphine is available in two oral forms -- short acting mixture and long acting tablets. The effect of short acting morphine mixture lasts only 4 hours and therefore it must be taken every 4 hours.</p>
<p>Long acting morphine tablets (also called slow release morphine tables or MST) are made so that the effect of the tablet will last up to 12 hours. Therefore long acting tables are usually taken every 12 hours. This means that the effect of the medicine will last throughout the night.</p>
<p>If you are taking long acting tablets and you have an episode of severe pain, you should not take additional long acting tablets. Instead you should take a dose of short acting morphine mixture which will relieve your pain very quickly. However, if you need many doses of short acting morphine mixture each day, your doctor may decide to increase your dose of long acting morphine tablets. </p>
<p>Long acting morphine tablets must not be crushed or chewed but should be swallowed whole.</p>
<p>Morphine can also be given by injection. Sometimes the morphine is given by a portable pump called syringe driver. The syringe driver injects a small dose of morphine continuously via a fine needle which is inserted under the skin and secured with adhesive plastic.</p>
<h2>Concerns About Morphine</h2>
<p>People are sometimes concerned about taking morphine. The fear of addiction is one of the main reasons why people either refuse to take morphine or take less than the amount prescribed. However, morphine is a safe and effective pain medication when used as prescribed by the doctor.</p>
<ul>
    <li>There is no evidence that taking morphine for pain control will lead to drug addiction. Many people who have been taking morphine for prolonged periods can gradually discontinue morphine when other methods of pain control have been successful. </li>
    <li>Morphine does not make people drowsy if used correctly. When a person first starts taking morphine there may be some feelings of drowsiness. However, this effect wears off after a couple of days. If the drowsiness persists, this may mean that a lower dose of morphine would control your pain adequately. </li>
    <li>Morphine is not used as a last resort and will not hasten death. Instead, morphine can be used safely at any stage of the disease if pain is not controlled by other pain medications. When prescribed correctly, morphine can give a new lease of life by making it possible to sleep well at night and to live a more normal active life during the day. </li>
    <li>Some people fear that the effectiveness of morphine will wear off and that the dose will need to be continually increased. This is not so. Many patients need only the same dose of morphine over many months. </li>
    <li class=last>Morphine can cause constipation and therefore regular laxatives (bowel medicines) are usually needed to prevent this. Senna, a laxative made from the pod of the senna plant, is commonly prescribed. Senna tablets can be purchased from the Chinese medicine shop or from the local pharmacy. It is also helpful to have an adequate intake of fluid to prevent constipation while you are taking morphine. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Palliative Care</h2>
<p>Palliative care, also called hospice care, is offered to people with advanced disease when the focus is on control of symptoms and emotional support. If your disease has progressed and you require additional support, your doctor can refer you to the palliative care physician or to one of the hospice home care programs.</p>
<p>Hospice staff will come to your home to assess your medical, nursing and emotional needs and will work with you and our family to develop a plan of care. They will arrange to visit you regularly. If there is an emergency, there will always be someone from the hospice on-call to assist you and your family.</p>
<p>If the family is no longer able to provide care at home, there are also in-patient hospices that provide short-term admission.</p>
<p>For others who are well enough to enjoy creative activities and outings, there are hospice day care centres that provide a supportive environment for people who attend the centre for the day.</p>
<p>Families who experience hospice care feel that it offers great comfort and support for them when they are caring for someone with advanced cancer.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If cancer recurs, it is sometimes difficult to recover physical and psychological strength. You may face prejudice and discrimination as you attempt to resume an active life.</p>
<p>However, this is an opportunity for you to re-evaluate what life is about, who you are, and what you value most. You may find that, when you have faced the challenge of living with cancer, you have a greater appreciation of life are better able to respond to your own needs and to the needs of others.</p>
