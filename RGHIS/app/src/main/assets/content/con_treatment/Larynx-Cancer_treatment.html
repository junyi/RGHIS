            <p><strong>Treatment of Larynx Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            Early stage cancers of the larynx are treated with radiotherapy and this allows the patients to have their voice boxes preserved. Seventy to 95 % of patients treated this way achieve local control. Those who fail are salvaged by surgery. More advanced tumours may be treated with radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy or surgery followed by radiotherapy. Patients who have had their larynxes removed by surgery can continue to speak in one of three ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Oesophageal speech (using air from the stomach) </li>
                <li>Amplification by a electronic device placed against the neck while speaking or </li>
                <li>Having a prosthetic device inserted into the tracheostome. </li>
            </ul>
