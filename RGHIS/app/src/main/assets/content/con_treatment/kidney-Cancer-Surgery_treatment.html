            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><strong>1. Early Kidney Cancer</strong></span></h2>
            <br>
            The treatment options for early cancer may include :<br>
            <br>
            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><strong>Surgery</strong></span></h2>
            <br>
            Surgery is the standard treatment option for those with kidney tumours who are fit for surgery. The extent of surgery may be categorised into two types : <br>
            <br>
            <strong>a. Partial nephrectomy</strong> where the tumour is removed with a margin of normal tissue, preserving the rest of the unaffected kidney.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>b. Radical nephrectomy.</strong> where the whole kidney including the tumour is removed.<br>
            <br>
            Partial nephrectomy is performed when the tumour is small or if the person has a single kidney left or has impaired kidney function. Radical nephrectomy is performed when the tumour is large and very close to the blood vessels or ureter. <br>
            <br>
            Kidney surgery may be performed using the conventional open laparoscopic or robot-assisted techniques, depending on the kidney tumour characteristics and patient suitability.<br>
            <br>
            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><strong>Radiofrequency ablation</strong></span></h2>
            <br>
            This is a minimally invasive ablative procedure that uses thermal energy to destroy tumour cells.<br>
            <br>
            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><strong>Active Surveillance</strong></span></h2>
            <br>
            In prostate cancer, male sex hormones can cause prostate cancer to grow. Hormonal therapy works by removing the Selected patients with a very small kidney tumour may be monitored closely with kidney scans to assess the growth rate or changes in the tumour appearance. <br>
            <br>
            Radiofrequency ablation and active surveillance are more suited for elderly patients with multiple medical problems and are not fit for surgery.<br>
            <br>
            As only one good kidney is needed to lead a normal life, most people with one kidney removed do not end up with kidney failure requiring dialysis. Your treating doctor will counsel you on the risks of impaired kidney function after surgery which depends on the presence of factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure and advanced age. <br>
            <br>
            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><strong>2. Advanced Kidney Cancer</strong></span></h2>
            <br>
            For selected patients who present late with kidney cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, surgery to remove the kidney in combination with systemic therapy has shown to be effective treatment even in advanced kidney cancer. <br>
            <br>
            Systemic treatment in this group of patient may include :
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Targeted therapy.</strong> Uses drugs that target specific tumour growth pathways in the cancer cell. </li>
                <li><strong>Immunotherapy.</strong> Uses drugs that incite the bodyв„ўs immune response towards the cancer. </li>
            </ul>
            If you are not fit for surgery, immunotherapy or targeted therapy may be given to control the disease with or without surgery later, depending on your response to treatment. It is reassuring to note that there are still very effective treatments for patients presenting late with advanced stage of kidney cancer. </div>
