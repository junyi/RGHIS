<h2>What Needs To Be Done For Obese Children?</h2>
<p>Obesity management programmes focus on decreasing caloric (food) intake and increasing energy expenditure through exercises. Behavioural modification of the child and his family may enhance the effectiveness of these programmes.</p>
<p>Interviews with obese children and their families reveal that regular family activities often include food or eating but rarely involve physical activities. Hence, it is hardly surprising that obese children often have obese siblings, parents or grandparents as everyone in the family has a similar diet (excessive calories and high in fats) and a similar lifestyle (sedentary). Interventions to reduce obesity in children should also be directed at their families and caregivers.</p>
<p>Today, domestic helpers and grandparents often take the place of mothers as the main caregivers. A holistic approach to obesity management should also include education and empowerment programmes for this new generation of caregivers.</p>
<h2>Why Exercise?</h2>
<p>Regular physical activity encourages energy expenditure, helps to build and maintain healthy bones, muscles and joints, improves eye-hand and eye-leg coordination and night rest. Other benefits of exercise in children are weight control, maintainenance of blood sugar and cardiovascular fitness. Children who are physically fit have a tendency to be physically active as an adult. In addition, exercise also improves their psychological well being, self-perception, self-esteem and social interaction skills.</p>
<h2>Managing Obesity Through Lifestyle Intervention</h2>
<p>At KK Hospital a Weight Management Clinic is available to help obese children (aged 6 to 18 years) improve their weight and health status. A medical doctor will assess the childв„ўs medical status and where suitable, will refer him / her for a lifestyle intervention program supervised by a team of exercise specialists and dieticians.</p>
<p>The aim of the program is to improve health status by controlling the rate of weight gain or reduce weight. This is achieved by encouraging the child to increase their physical activity, reduce sedentary lifestyle and adopting a healthier eating behaviour. Family involvement is vital to ensure success of the programme. Parents and caregivers will also be counseled and educated on tips to support their child as they make these lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>At the start of the program, a comprehensive family, social and physical activity history of the child will be taken. An exercise specialist will conduct a fitness assessment and will provide appropriate recommendations for physical activity based on the current physical activity profile and fitness level of the child. Following the assessments, the child will be enrolled into the structured exercise program at KKH Fitness Centre. These sessions are supervised by a team of exercise specialists and will comprise of safe and fun-filled exercises designed to improve a childв„ўs overall fitness and increase their motivation to be more active. Participants will be required to set regular short-term lifestyle goals to help them achieve their long-term health goals. </p>
<h2>Recommended Age Appropriate Activities And Fitness Promotion</h2>
<h2>1 - 3 years</h2>
<p>During this phase, children are curious, like to touch, pick and feel everything in sight. They tend to climb upward more than down and are able to jump. Towards 2 to 3 years, they should be able to kick a ball and ride a tricycle. Physical activities that allow play with active movement are encouraged. Types of activities should be changed frequently because of their short attention span.</p>
<h2>3 - 6 years</h2>
<p>Children have improved fine and gross motor skills with increased walking stride. They are able to hop, skip and run at variable speed. Skills like ball throwing have improved control and precision. They should be encouraged to participate in activities that develop their muscles, strength and coordination e.g. riding tricycle or bicycle, running, skipping, hopping and swimming. Parents are important role models during this phase as children are beginning to participate in physical activities with parents and others.</p>
<h2>6 - 12 years </h2>
<p>Children have improved strength, physical ability and coordination. Their own physical ability, interest and reaction of peers will influence them. Encourage participation in activities that interest the child. Activities that focus on aerobic conditioning, strength and endurance development are encouraged.</p>
<h2>12 - 20 years</h2>
<p>Growth and development continue to increase and physical activities are greatly influenced by peer pressure. The use of role models should be encouraged to increase physical activities that improve strength, endurance and coordination.</p>
<p>Treatment of obese children is successful if realistic goals are set, balanced diet emphasised, physical activity increased, with strong parental support and behavioral modification. However, preventing obesity is more important than the treatment itself. So, adopt a healthier and active lifestyle.</p>
