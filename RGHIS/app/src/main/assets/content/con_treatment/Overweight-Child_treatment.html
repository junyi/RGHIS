<h2>Practical Steps To Help Your Overweight Child</h2>
<p>The aim is to reach and maintain a healthy weight appropriate for the height of your child. The best way to achieve this is by making small but permanent changes in eating habits and physical activity, instead of drastic changes that most probably will not last for long. Remember, healthy eating habits should be gradually developed, so do not put your child on an overly-restrictive diet as this is likely to fail. It is better to allow small amounts of foods like chocolate, ice cream or tit-bits once a week than not at all.</p>
<h2>Cut down on Fat and Oil</h2>
<p>Reducing fat is a good way to cut calories without depriving your child of important nutrients. Simple ways to cut the fat in your family's diet include :</p>
<ul>
    <li>Removing the skin on the poultry, and using lean meat </li>
    <li>Changing to low fat milk and dairy products </li>
    <li>Reducing the amount of oil used in cooking. Instead of deep-frying your food, try steaming, stewing, grilling, baking or microwaving </li>
    <li class=last>Avoid using coconut milk in curries. Switch to low fat milk, low fat yoghurt or low fat evaporated milk. Tomatoes and onions are also good substitutes for thickening your gravy </li>
</ul>
<h2>Encourage Regular Eating Habits</h2>
<p>Children who skip their main meals tend to eat more snacks. As snacks are often high in calories and low in fibre, this may lead to overeating.</p>
<h2>Discourage Meals Or Snacking While Watching TV</h2>
<p>Encourage eating only at the dining table. Eating in front of the TV is distracting and it is easy to lose track of the amounts eaten, thus leading to overeating.</p>
<h2>Do Not Use Foods As Rewards Or Punishments</h2>
<p>When foods like sweets or fast foods are used as a reward, children will assume that these foods are better or more valuable than others.</p>
<h2>Practice Healthy Eating Habits As A Family</h2>
<p>Not only will your child not feel singled out, the whole family benefits from a healthier diet and a more active lifestyle.</p>
<h2>Increase Your Family's Physical Activities</h2>
<p>Regular physical activity, combined with healthy eating habits, is the most effective way to control your child's weight.</p>
<p>Try these:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Plan activities that everyone in the family can enjoy like walking, cycling or swimming. Go for a walk after dinner instead of sitting down in front of the TV set. </li>
    <li>Encourage more outdoor play </li>
    <li class=last>Be a role model for your child. If he sees that you are physically active, he is more likely to be active and stay active for the rest of his life. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Remember</h2>
<p>Although your child may be overweight, he is also growing. Therefore, the aim is not for him to lose weight but rather to gain weight at a slower rate. Treatment programmes, if any, should be carried out under medical supervision to ensure that it is safe, and that your child is not deprived of any essential nutrients.</p>
<p><strong>Be there for your child - he needs your support and encouragement. </strong></p>
