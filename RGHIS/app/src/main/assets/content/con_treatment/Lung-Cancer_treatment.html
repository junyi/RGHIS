            <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Treatment of Lung Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            There are two main types of lung cancer; small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. The diagnosis is based on what the pathologist (a specialist who looks at tissues under the microscope) sees on microscopic examination of the tissue and after special staining tests have been performed on the tissue.<br>
            <br>
            Small cell lung cancer is more rapidly growing and spreads earlier to other organs as compared to non-small cell lung cancer. About 10% of all lung cancers are small cell lung cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer grows slower than small cell lung cancer and tends to be confined to the lung for a longer period of time. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Treatment of Small Cell Lung Cancer<br>
            </strong><br>
            Small cell lung cancer tends to spread early to other organs, such as liver, bone and brain. Therapy involves early chemotherapy. If the cancer has not spread beyond the confines of one lung, chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy has been shown to have better results than just chemotherapy alone.<br>
            <br>
            Chemotherapy is given over a period of 4 to 6 months. There is usually mild nausea or vomiting, complete hair loss, lethargy or tiredness, and loss of appetite. The exact choice of medicine will depend on the person's general health and other prevalent medical problems.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Prognosis of Lung Cancer<br>
            </strong><br>
            Prognosis means the probable outcome of an illness based upon all the relevant facts of the case. All findings from clinical examination and x-ray investigations and pathology reports are important and must be considered together to decide what the progress of an individual case of lung cancer may be. From this, the appropriate course of treatment can be decided and put into action. The treatment strategy will vary from person to person.</p>

                <div style="text-align:justify">Which of the neighbouring lymph glands were involved? Were all the involved lymph glands removed at surgery? Which other sites in the body are involved with cancer? </div>

                <div style="text-align:justify">Did the pathologist see high risk features such as small cell lung cancer? Small cell lung cancer is a rapidly growing cancer. Very often, the cancer has spread to many other organs at the time of diagnosis. Were other organs involved? </div>

                <li>
                <div style="text-align:justify">If the person has other underlying medical problems, surgery may not be possible even if the cancer was small and considered to be early stage. Lung cancer commonly develops in smokers who have lung damage from their many years of smoking. Smoking also increases a person's risk of heart disease and stroke, which may mean that surgery will be high risk. </div>
