                <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Treatment and Prevention</span></h2>
                <p>Once kidney failure reaches a certain degree, it usually will progress to end stage kidney failure. Nevertheless, there are some common treatment that can benefit most patients with established kidney disease.<br>
                <strong><br>
                General Measures</strong><br>
                <br>
                <strong>(i) Treat hypertension (high blood pressure):</strong> It is important that high blood pressure is treated. Apart from medication that a patient should take regularly, the patient should also restrict his salt intake, and try to lose weight. Regular clinic visits or home blood pressure monitoring gives the doctor the needed information so that blood pressure treatment can be adjusted to suit the patients needs and achieve appropriate blood pressure levels. Apart from reducing the progression of renal failure, blood pressure control has the important added advantage of reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes,<br>
                <br>
                <strong>(ii) Anti-proteinuric therapy: </strong>Some kidney diseases are associated with protein loss in the urine. Certain medications can decrease / lower the amount of protein excreted in the urine. This group of drugs (called angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) needs to be prescribed by the doctor. These drugs are usually prescribed more commonly in the early stage of renal disease. While on this treatment, the patient will need to have regular checks of the kidney function. This group of medications can effectively reduce the progression of renal disease. Not all patients are suitable for this form of treatment, nor do all patients tolerate this medication equally well. They can be associated with intolerable cough, and like any medications, may cause some patients to develop an allergic rash.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>(iii) Restrict protein in the diet: </strong>Restricting dietary protein is another therapy for patients in the early phase of renal disease. A low protein diet reduces the progression of kidney disease. Proteins also contain a large amount of phosphate and acid. A low protein diet has the added benefits of reducing the load of phosphates and acids delivered to the body, both of which are less efficiently removed in kidney disease. A low protein diet however, can only be prescribed to patients who are well nourished. Patients who have evidence of malnutrition would not benefit from dietary protein restriction, as this may in fact worsen their malnutrition.<br>
                <strong><br>
                (iv) Control of cholesterol (blood fat):</strong> This can be done by dietary restriction of food with a high fat content. However, this is usually only adequate for patients with only mild elevation of the serum cholesterol levels. More often, patients will need medication to reduce their cholesterol levels to a more acceptable level. Like controlling hypertension, cholesterol control has the additional benefit of reducing the incidence of heart attacks.<br>
                <br>
                Apart from these general therapies, it is important also to treat the cause of renal failure as well.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Specific Measures</strong><br>
                <strong><br>
                Diabetes Mellitus:</strong> As many as 30% of all diabetic patients will develop renal failure. It is critical to control to the blood sugar, as controlling the blood sugar well can prevent the initial development of renal disease. Even when kidney disease is already established, sugar control is still important. Paradoxically, the control of blood sugar is usually easier in patients with established kidney disease. It would however be incorrect to view this as the diabetes being cured; at this stage, the diabetic patient would have many other complications of long standing diabetes. (See section 4 for details of associated conditions)<br>
                <strong><br>
                Glomerulonephritis:</strong> Some patients with different kinds of glomerulonephritis can benefit from therapy with a group of drugs called immunosuppressants. Examples of these drugs are steroids, cyclosporine, or cyclophosphamide. All these drugs carry with them their unique efficacy and side effects, and it is best to discuss these with the attending renal physician as to which is the most appropriate therapy for the specific kidney disease<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Reflux Nephropathy:</strong> In children with this condition, taking antibiotics over a long period of time can prevent urine infections. Reducing the frequency of infections can reduce the development of kidney disease developing over the long period of time. More severe cases if detected early enough may require surgery.</p>

                </span></h2>
                <p>A patient is dependent on his kidneys to survive. A patient who has extensive and irreversible kidney damage needs to have some form of renal replacement therapy. There are two forms of renal replacement therapy; the first is kidney dialysis and the other is a kidney transplant.<a name=section8></a></p>
