<h2>How Is Ovarian Cancer Diagnosed?</h2>
<p><strong>Initial tests</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Examination by a doctor<br>
    </strong>Your doctor may feel an enlarged ovary or discover a suspicious abnormality. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ultrasound scan<br>
    </strong>This is a painless test used to see the structures inside your body. The probe may be placed on your abdomen or inside your vagina to scan the ovaries. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Blood test<br>
    </strong>A protein called CA-125 can be detected in a blood sample. The level of CA-125 can be high in women with ovarian cancer. Blood test is also often used to monitor the effects of treatment for ovarian cancer.  </li>
</ul>
However, other non-cancerous conditions can also cause a high level of CA-125. Thus, this test is not a conclusive gauge for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer.
<p><strong>Further Tests<br>
</strong>You may be advised to go for further tests depending on the symptoms that you have and the results of the initial tests.</p>
<ul>
    <li>CT or MRI scan of the lower abdomen can provide details of the internal organs structure and help to determine the extent of the disease. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>A chest X-ray to check if the cancer has spread to your lungs. </li>
    <li>Blood tests to assess your general health and to check if the cancer has affected the function of your liver or kidneys. </li>
    <li>Scans of the bowel or urinary tract eg. Colonoscopy (a procedure to look inside<br>
    your bowel). These tests are more likely to be needed if you have symptoms such as constipation or urinary frequency which may indicate that the cancer has spread to these areas. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Aspiration of fluid. If your abdomen is swollen with fluid leading to ascites, a sample of fluid will be taken. This is done by numbing a small area of skin on the abdomen with local anaesthetic. A fine needle is inserted through the abdominal wall and some fluid is removed. This fluid is examined under the microscope to look for cancer cells. </li>
</ul>
<strong>Note:</strong> Even with the above tests, the only way to confirm the diagnosis of ovarian cancer is through surgery.

<h2>Surgery For Ovarian Cancer</h2>
<p>Surgery is required for diagnosis and to determine the extent of the disease (staging).Ovarian cancer surgery is preferably done by a gynaecological oncologist to achieve a desirable outcome. Gynaecological oncologists are specialist cancer surgeons who are specially trained in the management of womenв„ўs cancers. </p>
<h2>Total Hysterectomy With Bilateral Salpingo-oopherectomy With Omentectomy And Lymphadenectomy</h2>
<p>This is the removal of the uterus with cervix (total hysterectomy), both ovaries and the tubes (bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy), the fat
