<h2>When Should It Be Treated?</h2>
<p>When symptoms of hearing loss persist, particularly at a time when a child is learning to speak, medical evaluation and treatment are recommended. Hearing loss is the single most important cause of a child having delayed speech.</p>
<p>Treatment Options</p>
<p>To improve eustachian tube function, a variety of medication may be used. Antibiotics, decongestants and nasal sprays are the more common ones. If this fails, surgical options will then be explored. For children, the operations performed are Myringotomy &amp; Tube insertion (M&amp;T) with or without adenoidectomy.</p>
<h2>Surgery</h2>
<center></center>
<p>M&amp;T is done under general anaesthesia as a day surgery. This simple procedure generally takes about 15 minutes and involves making a cut on the drum and placing a tiny ventilation tube through it. This thus allows ventilation of the middle ear. Admission to the hospital is required only when adenoidectomy is done as well. Generally, a total of 48 hours' stay is required. </p>
<p>Shortly after admission, blood tests will be carried out. The child will be required to fast overnight i.e. no food or drink after 12 midnight before the operation. For a younger child, a shorter period of fasting might be sufficient, depending on the anaesthetist's assessment.</p>
<h2>Preparation For Surgery</h2>
<p>The doctor should be informed if the child has fever and cough just before the surgery. The surgery might be postponed if the child is found to be unfit for surgery. If the child has any history/family history of bleeding disorder or any previous problems with anaesthesia, it should be brought to the doctor's attention.</p>
<h2>Soon After Surgery</h2>
<p>The child might still be sleepy and have vomiting from the effects of general anaesthesia. This will wear off with a little time. After a few hours, he will be allowed to drink water. Eating will resume depending on the child's state. An immediate improvement in hearing should follow after surgery.</p>
<h2>After Discharge</h2>
<p>There is no dietary restriction and normal diet and oral hygiene should resume.</p>
<p>The ventilation tubes placed through the eardrum will be automatically expelled in 6 months' to a year's time. This might need removal by the doctor from the ear canal during a follow-up visit.</p>
<h2>Precautions</h2>
<p>Keep the ears dry as water in the middle ear increases the chance of infection. Do not allow shower spray to be directed into the ears. Older children will still be able to swim but this should be done while wearing good ear plugs. Placing of the head under water is to be avoided. Diving or swimming should be avoided in children below age 6. In the event of an ear infection, where there is pus discharging from the ears, medical opinion should be sought.</p>
<h2>Emergencies</h2>
<p>If the child experiences purulent ear discharge or pain some time after the operation, please seek treatment at Children's Emergency, Basement 1, KK Women's and Children's Hospital. They will then contact the ENT doctors as required.</p>
<h2>Follow-Up Appointment</h2>
<p>Usually, a single post-operative follow-up date in about 3 to 6 months' is given. Do keep your appointment with the doctor as the follow-up care is important to ascertain extrusion of the tube and if there is recurrence of middle ear fluid.</p>
