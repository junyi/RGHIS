            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>Diagnosis usually begins with a neurological exam and includes  and  of the brain.</p>
            <p>Additional tests such as a cerebral angiogram may be necessary to exclude the other possible causes of an ICH as listed above.</p>
            <p>A CT brain scan showing a large blood clot with surrounding pressure and swelling of the brain structures.</p>

            Treatment Options</span></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Medications for control of blood pressure and reduction of brain swelling will be instituted. If an individual is in a coma, intensive care support will be needed. </li>
                <li>If the blood clot is small, the patient needs to be monitored closely for progressive deterioration from an enlarging clot. </li>
                <li>If the blood clot is large and the patient is already unconscious, then surgery needs to be performed urgently for evacuation of the blood clot and to relieve pressure from the surrounding brain structures. </li>
                <li>If an abnormal blood vessel or AVM is found, surgery may be required to correct and prevent future brain hemorrhage. </li>
                <li>If a tumor is found, surgery may be required to remove it. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Outcome<br>
            </strong><br>
            Factors that affect prognosis after intracerebral hemorrhage are :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients age and concurrent medical conditions </li>
                <li>Initial neurological state of consciousness </li>
                <li>Size and location of the hematoma </li>
                <li>Presence of blood into the ventricles </li>
            </ul>
            Patients will a small hematoma may have residual neurological deficits and may benefit from inpatient rehabilitation. <br>
            <br>
            The prognosis however is generally poor for patients with large ICH and long-term mental and physical disability usually occurs.</div>
