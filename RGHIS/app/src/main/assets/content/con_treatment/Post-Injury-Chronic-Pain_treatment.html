            <p><strong>How do we treat CRPS?</strong></p>
            <p>The objectives of CRPS treatment are relieving pain and restoration of function of the affected limb. Your doctor may prescribe pain medications that work specifically on nerves to reduce pain signals to the brain. </p>
            <p>When medications fail to control pain, your pain specialist may perform one or a series of nerve blocks with local anaesthetics for treatment. A series of blocks can be performed. </p>
            <p>Physical and occupational therapy play an integral role in CRPS treatment. The aim is to maintain or improve function and mobility of the affected limb. Following adequate analgesia, therapy focuses on range of motion exercises, strengthening, and aerobic conditioning. </p>
            <p>CRPS patients that have not responded to drugs or nerve blocks may be suitable candidates for spinal cord stimulation. Spinal cord stimulation involves placement of electrical wires over the spinal cord. When an electrical current is stimulates the spinal cord, pain signals to the brain are interrupted.</p>
