<h2>What can eye doctors do for dry eye patients?</h2>
<p>The role of eye doctors in dry eye includes the following: assessment and treatment for other conditions that may look like or coexist with dry eye, for example, allergic eye diseases, eye infections, loss of sensation of the cornea, and eyelid deformity; assessment for dry eye related to systemic illnesses such as thyroid eye disease, counseling on the eye related interventions that may aggravate the condition, for example corneal surgery for myopia and assessment of dry eye severity.  </p>
<h2>What kinds of treatments are available for Dry Eye?</h2>
<p>In cases of dry eyes that do not have clinical damage to the ocular surface (what your doctor refer to as staining or keratitis), it is considered safe for patients to attempt to control the condition using over-the-counter medications called lubricants without regular visits to health care practitioners. Severe dry eye can be treated using more sophisticated methods such as steroids, punctal occlusion or surgery to close the lids.<br>
