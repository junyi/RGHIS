<h2>Will There Be Stitches?</h2>
<p>Either absorbable stitches or glue will be used. Hence there is no need to remove stitches. We do not use the Plastibell device so there will be no ring to remove. Depending on who your surgeon is, he may have a transparent dressing applied to the penis.</p>
<h2>Will It Be Painful After The Surgery?</h2>
<p>After surgery, your child will be prescribed oral painkiller medicine (paracetamol). He may have a smarting sensation on passing urine initially, for which he can apply an anaesthetic gel (lignocaine gel).</p>
<h2>How Do I Take Care Of The Wound?</h2>
<p>You will be given detailed instructions on wound care. Your child can continue showering as per normal after the operation. Generally it is advisable to wear loose clothing (e.g. sarong) until the wound is dry. Ensure that he doesn't pick at the scabs to avoid bleeding. Do not allow him to straddle toys, cycle or swim until the wound has healed.</p>
<h2>What Do I Do If It Bleeds?</h2>
<p>If there is slight bleeding, apply a clean gauze and hold for a few minutes. If there is persistent bleeding, please bring him back to the Children's Emergency. Meanwhile, do not give him any food or drink until the wound has been assessed by the doctor.</p>
<h2>When Can My Child Go Back To School?</h2>
<p>He will be given a medical certificate for two weeks. Some boys are able to go back to school sooner if their wounds heal more quickly.</p>
