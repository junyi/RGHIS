<h2>How are Corneal Infections treated?</h2>
<p>Corneal infections are usually treated with anti-infective eyedrops and eye ointment. In the case of bacterial infections, antibiotic eyedrops are usually prescribed. In most cases, patients with severe corneal infections are admitted into hospital and samples from the infection are taken to identify the likely organism before the start of the treatment. Treatment with intensive eye drops is administered and adjusted until the infection improves.</p>
<h2>Is surgery necessary?</h2>
<p>Surgery for corneal infections may be indicated in very severe infections or when the infection is not responding to medical treatment i.e. eyedrops. Surgery may also be indicated later on if vision is reduced due to corneal scarring from the infection. Surgery carried out in these situations aims to remove the diseased cornea (where scarring or severe infections is present) and replace the removed cornea with a corneal graft or transplant. </p>

<h2>What does cornea graft surgery involve?</h2>
<p>Corneal graft surgery may involve:</p>
<p>1. removing all the affected cornea and replacing it with a full thickness corneal graft (Penetrating <br>
    Keratoplasty)</p>
<p>2. removing only the layers affected and replacing with a partial thickness corneal graft (Lamellar <br>
    Keratoplasty)</p>
