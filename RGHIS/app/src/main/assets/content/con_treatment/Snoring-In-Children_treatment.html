            Treatment</span></h2>
            <p>Effective treatment is available for almost all patients. The treatment of snoring is divided into medical and surgical options. The choice of therapy will depend on the underlying cause and the extent of the problem. <br>
            <br>
            A staged approach is often used, which involves medical therapy first, followed by consideration of surgery. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Medical <br>
            </strong><br>
            As nasal obstruction increases the frequency of snoring and sleep disordered breathing, your doctor may prescribe oral medications to help your child breathe through his nose during sleep. For those diagnosed with sleep apnoea, Nasal CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) is used to supply pressurised air into the upper airway via a nasal mask. This keeps the upper airway open. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Surgical <br>
            </strong><br>
            Surgical procedures for the treatment of snoring may include surgery of the nose, palate, jaw, tongue and/or neck, depending on the location of the tissues contributing to the snoring. Certain nasal conditions such as deviated nasal septum and very large tonsils may require assessment by the ENT surgeon. <br>
            <br>
            Some patients may have extra tissue in the throat, which when removed may help to alleviate snoring. This surgical procedure is called uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP). Excess tissues may also be removed using laser surgery. Another procedure, somnoplasty or radiofrequency thermal ablation of the soft palate, stiffens and shrinks the tissues of the soft palate, and is also used to treat snoring. </p>
            <p><strong>Useful Suggestions </strong> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Obesity adds to the risk of snoring and apnoea. If your child is obese, his weight must be managed along with his treatment. </li>
                <li>Sleep on the side and avoid sleeping on the back. Some snore, or snore heavily, only when sleeping on the back. </li>
            </ul>
