            <p>Keep your child away from sick children. Have your child vaccinated with the appropriate vaccines, such as pneumococcal and Haemophilus vaccines, to prevent pneumonia and meningitis and reduce risk of ear infections. Keep the ear dry. Avoid swimming and touching the ear.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">When To Seek Help</span></h2>
            <p>You should bring your child to see a doctor at the first sign of a possible ear infection so that your child can be treated promptly.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Treatment Options</span></h2>
            <p>The doctor may give your child eardrops if he or she has an outer ear infection. For middle ear infection, a course of antibiotics is usually given together with medication to ease your childв„ўs pain and fever. For children with glue ear, tubes (grommets) may be inserted to prevent fluid from accumulating in the middle ear; this helps to restore the childв„ўs hearing. If your child has had recurrent ear infections, he or she may need a hearing test.</p>
