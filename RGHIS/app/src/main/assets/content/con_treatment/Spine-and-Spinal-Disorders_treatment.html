            Treatment Options</span></h2>
            <p>Treatment in most cases consists of conservative methods such as rest, medications and physiotherapy. <br>
            <br>
            Intervention is indicated for severe symptoms or failure to respond to therapy. One option is nerve block techniques (injection of steroids or radiofrequency lesions) will help reduce or eliminate the pain. <br>
            <br>
            The final option is surgical treatment. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Innovative Techniques</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Microscopic discectomy (where the damaged disc is removed). </li>
                <li>Artificial disc surgery - where the damaged disc is replaced with an implanted metallic disc </li>
                <li>Percutaneous pedicle screw (minimal invasive spine technique) </li>
                <li>Endoscopic disectomy (minimal invasive spine technique) </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tumours of the Spine<br>
            </strong><br>
            This may include tumours of the spinal column or the spinal cord. Tumours may be primary (originating from the spine) or more commonly spread from other sites (such as liver, lung and breast). They produce a variety of symptoms, like <strong>back/leg pain</strong>, neurological symptoms (weakness, numbness, unsteady gait). <br>
            <br>
            Treatment is dependent on the patientв„ўs condition, extent of tumour and severity of symptoms. Surgical decompression to relieve spinal cord or nerve pressure may be needed to obtain relief from symptoms. Additional procedure may be needed to stabilise the spine. Further treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be necessary. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Spinal Trauma<br>
            </strong><br>
            Injuries to spine are common in road traffic accidents, falls from height and diving injuries. Spine fractures can cause pain or neurological deficits. Surgery is needed in cases where the spine is rendered unstable or there is a blood clot or prolapsed disc causing acute cord compression. </p>
