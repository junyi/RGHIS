<h2>How Can I Seek Help?</h2>
<p>If your child has the symptoms described above and you suspect autism or ASD, you may make an appointment for your child to see a developmental paediatrician at the Department of Child Development (DCD) at KK Hospital. At this consult, the need for further assessment will be evaluated. Should the developmental paediatrician deem it necessary, your child may then be seen by the psychologist or therapists (speech and language, occupational or physical therapists). These people will assess your child to determine his level of function, need for intervention and subsequent educational placement. The professionals, co-ordinated by the developmental paediatrician, who will be your child's case manager, work as a team to formulate plans to optimise your child's development.</p>
<p>Parents may also become members of the Autistic Association of Singapore (AAS) or join the library at the Autism Resource Centre (ARC) and be more informed about this disorder.</p>
