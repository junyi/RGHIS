            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Procedure</span></h2>
            <p><em><strong>Before the examination <br>
            </strong></em><br>
            To provide you with the best possible care, our staff at the MRI Centre will need to know certain information about you and your medical history. </p>
            <p>Please inform the staff if you have: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>a pacemaker, surgical clips, or any metal objects or surgical implants in your body </li>
                <li>Artificial heart valves </li>
                <li>Neuro-stimulators </li>
                <li>Metal sharpnels in the body </li>
                <li>Metal fragments in your eyes </li>
                <li>any intra-uterine contraceptive device </li>
                <li>a prosthesis </li>
                <li>Dentures </li>
                <li>Or if you are likely to be pregnant. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The radiologist will then determine from the information whether you will be able to undergo the MRI examination.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Preparation for the examination</em></strong> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>No restriction on food / fluid intake is necessary; </li>
                <li>If you are on any prescribed medications, please continue the medication as directed by your physician; </li>
                <li>Do not wear make-up, especially mascara, or use hairspray. Contact lenses have to be removed for the examination; </li>
                <li>On your appointment day, please bring any X-rays, ultrasound and CT scan films that you may have. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><em><strong>On Arrival</strong></em></p>
            <p>You will be required to change into a hospital gown. All metallic objects e.g. jewellery, keys, watches, hearing aids, pins and credit cards must be removed before entering the magnet room. A locker will be provided for your belongings but please keep your valuables at home. <br>
            <br>
            <strong><em>During the MRI Examination</em></strong> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You will be positioned on a padded table and slowly moved into a magnet that surrounds the body with a magnetic field </li>
                <li>Once you are comfortably positioned, it is important that you remain relaxed and completely still during the scan. Movement will result in unclear images. </li>
                <li>Breathe normally, as there is nothing about the procedure to make you uncomfortable. </li>
                <li>You will notice a faint knocking and intermittent humming and thumping sounds which represents the changes in the magnetic field. Earplugs will be provided. </li>
                <li>You will have voice contact with the radiographer at all times and you can be seen clearly from the control room </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have any questions about the examination, do not hesitate to ask the radiographer attending to you. </p>
            <p><strong><em>After The Examination<br>
            </em></strong><br>
            Please do not change out of your hospital gown immediately after the examination. It may be necessary to do some additional views/sequences after the initial images were processed and reviewed.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Results of the Examination</span></h2>
            <p>The radiologist will review the images and report the findings to your physician, who will then discuss the results with you on your next appointment. </p>
            <a name=section4></a>
            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Possible Risks</span></h2>
            <p>An undetected metal implant may be affected by the strong magnetic field. </p>
            <a name=section5></a>
            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Limitations</span></h2>
            <p>In most cases the examination is safe for patients with metal implants, with the exception of a few types of implants, so patients should inform the radiographer of an implant prior to the test.</p>
