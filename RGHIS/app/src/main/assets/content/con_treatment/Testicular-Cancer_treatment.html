            <p><strong>Treatment of Testicular Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            Orchidectomy is performed to remove the affected testis if the cancer is localized. If there is advanced cancer, this may be done after chemotherapy in order to shrink the tumour first. Following surgery for early testicular cancer, chemotherapy or radiotherapy may be required to reduce the risk of recurrence. Chemotherapy is used if there is advanced cancer involving other organs such as the lungs or liver1. Side effects of chemotherapy which are injected into veins include temporary nausea and vomiting, mouth ulcers, hair loss, loss of appetite and tiredness. </p>
            <p><strong>Prognosis of Testicular Cancer<br>
            </strong><br>
            Clinical examinations, scans and pathology reports all help the medical team decide what is the stage of the germ cell tumor. The appropriate course of treatment may then be recommended. The treatment strategy will vary from person to person. Prognosis of testicular cancer is generally very good. It depends on the extent of the disease, the state of health of the individual as well as response to treatment. With appropriate treatment, cure rates of up to 80% have been reported even for patients with advanced testicular germ cell tumor. Patients with early stage testicular cancer have reported cure rates of more than 95% with appropriate treatment. Close monitoring of blood markers together with radiological assessment is essential to detect early recurrence of cancer.</p>

            Frequently Asked Questions</span></h2>
            <p><strong>I have had a lump in my testis for a while. It is not painful.<br>
            </strong><br>
            Testicular cancer is usually not painful. If there is a lump seek early medical attention. Although it may not be cancerous, it is better to have it checked.</p>
            <p><strong>I have only one testis.<br>
            </strong><br>
            Normally, two testes are formed in the embryo, which descend before birth to lie in the scrotum. Occasionally one or both testes do not descend. There is a higher chance of cancer developing in undescended testes; therefore it is advisable to seek early medical attention. Surgery may be required to bring the testis back into the scrotum.</p>
            <p><strong>Will cancer treatment for testicular cancer affect my ability to have children in the future and how can that be mitigated?</strong></p>
            Yes, fertility will be affected by chemotherapy and as such your physician will likely refer you to a reproductive clinic for cryopreservation of your sperm to be used at a later stage post treatment should the need arise.  <br>
