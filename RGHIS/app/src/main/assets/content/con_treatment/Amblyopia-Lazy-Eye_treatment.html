<h2>What kinds of treatments are available for lazy eye (amblyopia)? </h2>
<p>Firstly, if there is abnormal spectacle power, the child needs to be given appropriate spectacles which need to be worn all the time. Next, the child need to be encouraged to use the lazy eye. This is usually done by patching or covering the good eye, often for several hours per day. Treatment may take months, and even years, and is often more effective when it is started earlier. When amblyopia is detected too late (eg. after the age of 8 years), it may not be possible to reverse the visual damage. It is therefore important that you have your child checked if you or the school health services suspects or picks up a potential problem. </p>
