<h2>Treatment Process And Duration</h2>
<p>Treatment for different patients varies from one day to a few weeks. You may be required to receive treatment on one or more treatment units.</p>
<p>In the treatment room, your radiographer will put makings on your skin in order to align your positioning on the treatment couch. The machine will be directed accurately towards the targetted area for treatment.</p>
<p>During the treatment process, your radiographer is constantly monitoring you through a close-circuit television camera equipped with an intercom facility.</p>
<p>Each treatment session may last between 5 to 20 minutes, depending on the complexity of the set-up as well as the dosage level to be given.</p>

<h2>Weekly Reviews</h2>
<p>During the course of the treatment, you will be reviewed once a week by your doctor. Your radiographer will inform you of your routine review dates.</p>

<p>Once your treatment has been completed, you will be required to come back for regular follow up at the National Cancer Centre as well as the scheduled appointments at the Gynaecological Cancer Centre at KK Hospital</p>
<h2>What Is Vaginal Douching?</h2>
<p>It is the procedure during which salted water or medicated cleansing solution (as per your doctors' recommendation) is used to wash away accumulated secretions, blood or discharges in the vagina that cause adhesions and may increase the risk of infection.</p>
<h2>Why Is It Important?</h2>
<p>During radiotherapy to the pelvic area, vaginal secretions will thicken into a glue-like fluid which causes adhesions (vaginal walls sticking together). This can no longer be parted making future examinations of the cervix impossible and sexual intercourse difficult. The secretions soon decrease, the vagina walls become dry and healing will occur over a period of time. Stenosis (hardening) and atrophy (shrinkage in size) may occur during healing and the use of vaginal cylinders and douching will decrease the extent of these effects./p&gt; </p>
<h2>Douching Clinic Appointment</h2>
<p>The Oncology Nurse Counsellors will see you on a Friday after commencing therapy to advise you on your douching schedule and demonstrate the use of the cylinder. These items will then be given to you.</p>
<h2>How Is Vaginal Douching Carried Out?</h2>
<p>The nurse will explain the procedure to you as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In a half squatting position, insert the douch nozzle as far in as is comfortable </li>
    <li>Squeeze bottle until all contents have been expelled </li>
    <li>Withdraw nozzle and dry off </li>
    <li>Wash the douche kit with soap, rinse and air dry bottle for next use </li>
</ul>
<p><em>N.B. If using a bathtub, bedpan or wide plastic basin, the procedure may be done lying down.</em></p>
<h2>When Is Vaginal Douching Carried Out?</h2>
<p>The side effects of radiation therapy usually start on the second week of treatment.</p>
<p>Your Oncology Nurse Counsellor will schedule a date around this time for you to attend the Douching/Dilator clinic. </p>
<h2>Use Of Vaginal Dilator</h2>
<p>In addition to vaginal douching, a cylindrical apparatus known as a vaginal dilator may be lubricated and inserted into the vagina to prevent adhesions.</p>
<p>The schedule is as follows: <br>
Three times a week for 3 months from the commencement of treatment and once a week thereafter for life. </p>
<h2>Sexual Advice</h2>
<p>You may resume intercourse 3 months after you have had major gynaecological surgery. Also, you may resume sexual intercourse as soon as you feel comfortable on completion of your course of radiotherapy. Consult your doctor or oncology nurse when in doubt.</p>
