<h2>Does My Child Need A Skull X-ray?</h2>
<p>Skull X-rays help to identify skull fractures. However, they do not directly show brain injury or bleeding within the skull.</p>
<p>A skull X-ray is not a reliable indicator of bleeding within the skull or brain injury. </p>
<p>Your doctor will examine your child and decide if a skull X-Ray is really necessary. <strong>Skull X-rays are seldom necessary. </strong></p>
<p>Clinically abnormal signs and symptoms as mentioned above are much more reliable than skull X-rays as predictors of injury or bleeding within the skull.</p>
<p>A normal skull X-ray does not rule not bleeding within the skull or brain injury.</p>
<p><strong>Close monitoring of the child's behaviour over the next 72 hours of head injury is still necessary even though the skull X-ray may be normal. </strong></p>
<p>If brain injury or bleeding within the skull is suspected, the patient will need urgent CT scan.</p>
