<h2>How Is Appendicitis Treated?</h2>
<p>This operation is done either through a small incision in the right lower abdomen (open appendicectomy) or through three small puncture wounds (laparoscopic surgery). The surgeon will discuss with you the options available.</p>
<h2>Before Surgery</h2>
<p>The surgeon will examine your child and explain the operation. Your child will need to have an empty stomach before the surgery can be done. No food or drinks are allowed for at least 6 hours before surgery as he may vomit during induction of anaesthesia. A drip is inserted for medications and fluids to prevent dehydration. The doctors and nurses will prepare your child for the surgery. The child will be brought on a trolley to the Operating Theatre. A parent/guardian is encouraged to accompany the child to the Operating Theatre. An anaesthetist will give the child medication to ensure he sleeps throughout the operation.</p>
<h2>After Surgery</h2>
<p>Once the surgery is completed, your child will be brought back to the ward. After a day or 2, he will be started on clear liquids and advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. Sitting up, deep breathing and walking are very important exercises after surgery. This may be difficult at first and pain medication is available.</p>
<p>If the appendix had perforated, your child may need to have antibiotics for several more days. You may find that the doctors have inserted tubes into the stomach (through a nostril to empty the stomach), the bladder (to help your child to pass urine), and sometimes a tube (or surgical drain) in the abdomen to let out the infected material. All these are temporary and will be removed as soon as your child is better. If he experiences very severe pain in the abdomen, let the doctors and nurses know. Pain medication is available, and is usually given via a continuous drip after operation.</p>
<h2>Going Home</h2>
<p>The recovery from surgery is usually fast and the child is often home in 2 - 3 days after surgery. If the appendix had perforated, he may need to stay longer e.g. 7 - 10 days for further treatment. Once the doctor has confirmed that your child can go home, you will receive the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Medication for pain relief. </li>
    <li>A follow-up appointment to see your surgeon at Specialist Outpatient Clinic K in 2 weeks' time, for review. </li>
    <li>Medical leave. </li>
    <li class=last>Exemption from physical education (PE) for 4 weeks. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Important Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Keep the wound dressing clean and dry. You may remove the adhesive dressing 1 week after discharge. </li>
    <li>Seek medical advice if there is fever, redness or discharge from the wound, or if your child has other complaints in the abdomen. </li>
    <li class=last>There is no diet restriction. A well balanced diet is recommended. </li>
</ul>
<p>Have a pleasant stay in Hospital!</p>
