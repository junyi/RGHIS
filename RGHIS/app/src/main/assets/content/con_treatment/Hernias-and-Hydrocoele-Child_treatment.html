<h2>What Is The Treatment For Hydrocoeles And Hernias?</h2>
<p>The operation is called a herniotomy. This involves a small incision in the groin so that the intact connection is found and tied off.</p>
<p>Generally for hydrocoeles in babies, surgery is unnecessary as the majority will close by the age of 1 year. Beyond which, the chance of it closing spontaneously is less likely and surgery is recommended.</p>
<p>For hernias, surgery should not be delayed as there is a risk of complications due to the intestine getting stuck.</p>
<h2>How Long Will The Healing Process Take?</h2>
<p>There is no need to remove stitches as absorbable sutures will be used to close the wound. There will be a clear adhesive wound dressing applied. This dressing can be removed after 1 week (or you can wait till the clinic appointment whereby your doctor will remove it for you).</p>
<p>Your child will be given medical leave for 1 week. But usually, the child can go back to school earlier if he can walk without discomfort.</p>
