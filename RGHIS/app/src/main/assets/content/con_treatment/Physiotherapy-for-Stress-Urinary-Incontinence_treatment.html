<h2>What Do I Need To Do To Prevent Worsening Of Stress Urinary Incontinence?</h2>
<h2>Do:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Keep body weight within healthy limits. By doing so, the weight of the abdominal contents pressing against the pelvic floor is lessened and prevents the pelvic floor from weakening further. </li>
    <li>Eat a diet rich in fibre and drink between 1.5 - 2 oz of fluids per day. </li>
    <li>Seek early treatment for prolonged cough, and stop smoking preferably. </li>
    <li>Tighten up your pelvic floor before lifting heavy objects, changing positions, coughing or sneezing - this can be taught by our hospital physiotherapists. </li>
    <li class=last>Pelvic floor exercises especially during and after deliveries. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Don't:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Lift heavy objects repeatedly. </li>
    <li class=last>Strain when moving your bowels. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Pelvic Floor Exercises are prescribed to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles and may involve the use of vaginal cones and biofeedback. </li>

</ul>
<p>The physiotherapist will review you on a monthly interval or less, to monitor progress. You will be prescribed a home exercise program of pelvic floor exercises. You can stop treatment after you have achieved optimal results as determined by your physiotherapist.</p>
