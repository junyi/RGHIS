<h2>Does My Child Need Antibiotics?</h2>
<p>Antibiotics do not work on viruses. Children usually recover from common viral infections spontaneously after several days.</p>
<p>Antibiotics are only useful for bacterial infections.</p>
<p>Some bacteria are smart, they can develop a resistance to antibiotics. </p>
<p>Repeated and improper use of antibiotics can cause an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria. </p>
<p>When this happens, your child's infection remains uncontrolled or may even get worse. </p>
<p>Progressively stronger and more expensive antibiotics will have to be used.</p>
<p>Some bacteria can even be resistant to all the potent antibiotics that have ever been invented. As a result, doctors may have no more weapons left to fight the infection.</p>

<h2>How Can I Protect My Child From Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria?</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Complete the course of antibiotics as prescribed</strong> even though your child may have started to feel better. This is necessary to help the body fight all the harmful bacteria. </li>
    <li><strong>Never share or use leftover antibiotics. </strong></li>
    <li>Don't expect or demand antibiotics for flu and allergic conditions. <strong>Consult your doctor when in doubt. </strong></li>
    <li><strong>Do not expect antibiotics to work instantly.</strong> A response is usually seen in 2 - 3 days' time. </li>
    <li><strong>See the doctor again if the illness gets worse or lasts a long time</strong>, so that your child can be reassessed and proper treatment can be given as needed. </li>
    <li class=last><strong>Do not &quot;doctor-hop&quot;. It is confusing for both patients and doctors.</strong> The chances of inappropriate or inadequate antibiotics and medications being prescribed are higher. </li>
</ul>
