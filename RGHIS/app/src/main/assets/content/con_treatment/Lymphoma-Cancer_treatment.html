            <p><strong>Treatment of Lymphoma Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            Treatment of lymphoma may require chemotherapy. <strong>Chemotherapy drugs </strong>are either injected into the hand veins or swallowed as pills. Each course of treatment is given at regulated intervals to kill cancer cells and allow the body to recover. The drugs circulate throughout the body and so will reach cancer cells even when they are widespread.</p>
            <p>Radiation therapy is a localized treatment using high-energy rays to kill lymphoma cells wherever the rays are directed. The area covered may just be the lymph nodes or organ involved by lymphoma or, in some cases, to a wider area encompassing the lymph nodes in the neck, chest and under both armpits. It may be given alone or combined with chemotherapy. Biological therapy uses products that boost the body's own immune system to fight cancer. It may be used alone or combined with chemotherapy.</p>
            <p>Many new developments in the field of biological therapy are emerging. Antibodies to one type of lymphoma have been developed and may be used when conventional treatment is no longer effective. The combined treatment of high dose chemotherapy is being studied for certain patients. Here chemotherapy is given at much higher doses than standard chemotherapy treatment to kill any remaining lymphoma cells. But the high dosage also kills healthy bone marrow that produces white blood cells (infection-fighting cells), red blood cells (cells that carry oxygen), and platelets (cells that prevent bleeding). To help the patient tolerates high dose chemotherapy, stem cells or bone marrow from the patient or donor is collected beforehand. After a patient receives the chemotherapy, the stem cells or bone marrow is returned to the patient through a drip in a hand vein.</p>
            <p>The stage of the lymphoma when diagnosed and whether it is slow growing or aggressive will determine the type of treatment given.</p>
            <p><strong>Prognosis of Lymphoma Cancer<br>
            </strong><br>
            Clinical examinations, x-rays and pathology reports age and overall health status of the patient all help the medical team decide what the progress of an individual case of Lymphoma may be. Then, the appropriate course of treatment will be put into action. The treatment strategy will vary from person to person. With prompt and appropriate treatment, the outlook for a person with Lymphoma is good.</p>
