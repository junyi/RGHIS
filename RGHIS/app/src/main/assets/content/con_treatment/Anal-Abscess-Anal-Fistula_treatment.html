            <p><strong>Abscesses</strong></p>
            <p>The abscess is treated by a small operation. This entails making an opening in the skin over the abscess to allow the pus to drain out from the infected cavity. The skin opening is not stitched up after the operation, and the wound needs to be cleaned daily. A large or deep abscess may require hospitalization and surgery under anaesthesia. Antibiotics are usually not effective in treating the abscess, because antibiotics are not able to enter the fluid within an abscess.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Fistulas</strong> </p>
            <p>Surgery is necessary to cure an anal fistula. Although fistula surgery is usually relatively straightforward, the potential for complication exists, and is preferably performed by a specialist in colon and rectal surgery. It may be performed at the same time as the abscess surgery, although fistulae often develop four to six weeks after an abscess is drained - sometimes even months or years later. Fistula surgery usually involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to open the tunnel, joining the external and internal opening and converting the tunnel into a groove that will then heal from within outward. However, if a large portion of the muscle is involved, your surgeon may choose to leave a suture (stitch) in the fistula first, followed by a second operation to cut the muscle at a later period. This operation needs to be done with care, as cutting too much muscle will lead to loss of control of bowel movement. Most of the time, fistula surgery can be performed on an outpatient basis - or with a short hospital stay. </p>
