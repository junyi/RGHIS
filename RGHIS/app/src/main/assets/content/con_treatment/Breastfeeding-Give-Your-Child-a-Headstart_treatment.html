<h2>Solutions To Some Problems In Breastfeeding</h2>
<h2>Sore Nipples</h2>
<p>This often occurs when you first start breastfeeding. To prevent having sore nipples, ensure your baby is positioned correctly.</p>
<ul>
    <li>After feeding, express a little milk on your nipples and let it air dry. </li>
    <li>You may want to go without a bra for a while everyday. </li>
    <li class=last>If soreness continues, express your milk by hand 5 - 6 times a day and give this milk to your baby. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Full Breasts</h2>
<p>The early fullness usually subsides within a few days. If your breasts are very full, your baby may have trouble attaching to your breast. You may have to: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Massage your breasts </li>
    <li class=last>Express a little milk to soften the areola before feeding your baby. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Engorgement</h2>
<p>This is the accumulation of milk in the breasts resulting in hardness, over distension, discomfort or pain.</p>
<p>Engorgement may be minimised by demand feeding, including night feeding and early feeding from birth.</p>
<p>You may adopt the following techniques to reduce the discomfort caused by engorgement:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Massage your breast, areola and nipple area to clear any blockage. </li>
    <li>Apply warm towels over your breast only when your milk is leaking. </li>
    <li>Otherwise apply cold towels or cabbage leaves on the breasts in between breastfeeding to reduce the swelling. </li>
    <li>Express a little breastmilk before and after each feed to relieve the tension. </li>
    <li class=last>Analgesic (e.g. Panadol) may be taken to relieve the pain. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Blocked Milk Ducts</h2>
<p>This occurs when the milk is not being 'emptied' efficiently. Blocked ducts may cause part of your breast to feel lumpy, hard or sore. To unblock the ducts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Gently massage the affected area before and while baby is feeding </li>
    <li>Take a hot shower or apply a warm towel over your breast </li>
    <li class=last>Change your feeding position e.g. to football hold </li>
</ul>
<p>If any part of your breast is red and/or painful, and/or if you feel shivery or feverish, seek medical attention immediately. There may be a breast infection. Continue breastfeeding to empty the affected breast and to maintain your milk supply. In most cases, you should be able to continue to breastfeed your baby. If in doubt, consult your doctor or a lactation consultant immediately.</p>
<h2>Consulting A Breastfeeding Consellor </h2>
<p>You should find breastfeeding a fulfilling experience as it enhances your relationship with your baby. Many women who breastfeed find that they are closer to their babies. You are encouraged to consult a breastfeeding counsellor if you have any enquiries or if you notice the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your nipples are sore and painful </li>
    <li>Your breasts are hard and painful </li>
    <li class=last>Your baby is extremely agitated when you breastfeed him </li>
