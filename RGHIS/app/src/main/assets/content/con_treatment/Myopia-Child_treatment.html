<h2>How can I help treat or prevent childhood myopia (short-sightedness)?</h2>
<p>There is no cure for myopia and one of the best ways to prevent myopia or slow its progression in your child is to ensure that he or she practices good eye care habits. This includes ensuring the near work is held further away, and that your child takes frequent breaks to rest their eyes. Outdoor activity should also be encouraged.</p>
<p>Alternatively, in cases where myopia is progressing rapidly, interventional measures such as atropine eye-drops can be considered.</p>

<h2>Good eyecare habits</h2>
<p> Hold any reading material 30 cm away from the face/eyes, and try to read while sitting upright rather than lying down<br>
 When watching television, the television must be approximately 2-metres away<br>
 Computer screens should be approximately 50 cm away from the eyes and adjusted<br>
to minimize glare <br>
 Lighting should be sufficient to illuminate the room when reading, using the computer or watching television, but not cause any glare<br>
 Encourage your child to take a break to rest the eyes every 30 to 40 minutes of reading or watching television; look out the window at far away objects and do eye exercises to relax the eyes<br>
 Encourage children to spend more time outdoors.</p>
