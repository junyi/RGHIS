            <p>As there is no way to predict if a polyp will become cancerous, all polyps should be removed. Most polyps can be removed during colonoscopy, either by catching and cutting them with a wire loop or destroying them by burning with an electrical current. Infrequently, a large polyp cannot be removed and surgery is then required.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Can Polyps Recur?</strong> </p>
            <p>A polyp does not recur after it is completely removed. However, new polyps will develop in at least 30 percent of people who previously have polyps. Patients with polyps need repeat colonoscopy to find and treat any new polyps.</p>
