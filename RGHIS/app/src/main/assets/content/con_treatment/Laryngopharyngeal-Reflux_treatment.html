            Treatment</span></h2>
            <p>The treatment of LPR is essentially similar to the treatment of gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD). It consists of lifestyle modifications, dietary modifications, anti-acid medication, and rarely surgery. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>1. Lifestyle modifications <br>
            </strong>Eat smaller, more frequent meals. A large meal will expand your stomach and increase upward pressure against the oesophageal sphincter. <br>
            <br>
            Limit your intake of acid-stimulating foods and beverages. Refer to dietary modifications outlined on the following page. <br>
            <br>
            Do not lie down for three hours after you eat. Lying flat makes it easier for the stomach contents to enter the oesophagus. When sleeping it sometimes helps to have the head higher than the stomach. This can be achieved by raising the head of the bed or using a mattress wedge. <br>
            <br>
            Maintain a reasonable weight. Being overweight increases the pressure in the abdomen which can push the stomach contents against the LES. <br>
            <br>
            Do not smoke. Nicotine in cigarettes relaxes the oesophageal sphincter. Smoking also stimulates production of stomach acid. <br>
            <br>
            Do not wear tight clothing or belt around the waist. This can squeeze the stomach, forcing its contents into the oesophagus. <br>
