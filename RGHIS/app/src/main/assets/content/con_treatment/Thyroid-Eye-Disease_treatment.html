<h2>What kinds of treatments are available for Thyroid Eye Disease?</h2>
<h2><span style="color:#000000"><strong><br>
<span style="color:#ff6600">Natural Course</span></strong></span></h2>
<p>It is common for thyroid eye disease to fluctuate within the first one to two years of the disease. Beyond this time, the disease tends to stabilize. Medical therapy (immunosuppression and radiotherapy) are more effective in the active phase of the disease whereas surgical treatment is usually reserved for patients in the inactive phase. It is important for you to be seen and treated by a doctor for the underlying thyroid disease throughout this period. Although the thyroid eye disease tends to improve with good thyroid hormone control, this is not always the case, and consultation with the eye doctor is necessary. </p>
<h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Local Therapy</span></h2>
<p>Tear substitutes and lubricants help to protect the surface of the eye from drying.  Sleeping on extra pillows helps to reduce swelling around the eyes. Double vision can be troublesome if it affects straightforward and down-looking positions (as in reading). Special lenses called prisms may relieve this.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Immunosuppression</span></h2>
<p>Your eye doctor will advise you on treatment for thyroid disease. Steroids are used in selected cases. Taken orally, steroids can cause many side effects when used over a long period of time. These include weight gain, gastric symptoms and bleeding, aggravation of diabetes and high blood pressure and decreased resistance to infection. Where possible, intravenous steroids are given instead. Steroid therapy may also be combined with the use of other immunosuppressive drugs.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Radiation</span></h2>
<p>Radiation is an effective way of reducing swelling of tissue around the eye and relieving compression of the optic nerve. The therapeutic dose used is low and is usually not associated with significant adverse effects.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Surgery</span></h2>
<p>When vision is threatened, early lid or orbital surgery may be necessary. Otherwise surgery is usually reserved for inactive disease. Surgical rehabilitation is usually staged with orbital decompression surgery to reduce proptosis, followed by squint and eyelid surgeries to eliminate diplopia and exposure respectively.<br>
