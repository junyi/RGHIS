            <p>Mild abdominal discomfort can be ignored or treated by a hot drink or simple antacid preparations available over the counter. Structural diseases should be suspected if the pains are persistent or severe. They are also more likely in persons over the age of forty, if the symptoms are of recent onset, when the pain goes to the back or wakes the person up at night. Other 'alarm' symptoms include vomiting, loss of appetite and weight, the passage of blood and yellowing of the eyes and skin. In such cases the doctor should be consulted so that appropriate tests can be carried out to diagnose or exclude structural causes of abdominal pain. Urgent medical attention should be sought when the pain is excruciating or unremitting, when there is persistent vomiting and/or high fever. These features may be due to an acute abdomen and prompt admission to hospital is then advisable.</p>
