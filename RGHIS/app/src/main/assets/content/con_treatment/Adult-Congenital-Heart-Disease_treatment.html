            <p>Having survived into adulthood, ACHD patients are now facing a new set of challenges encompassing not only medical or surgical problems but extending to psychological, vocational and lifestyle issues. Congenital heart disease is a heterogenous condition with a wide spectrum of varying complexity and severity. Therefore, all ACHD patients (with the exception of those with mild isolated valvular heart disease or those with repaired Patent Ductus Arteriosus, Ventricular Septal Defect and Atrial Septal Defect) should be followed up in a specialised ACHD unit with a dedicated multidisciplinary team who can anticipate the various issues particular to each individual. Only then can we provide adequate care and work towards improving the clinical outcome of this special group of patients.</p>
