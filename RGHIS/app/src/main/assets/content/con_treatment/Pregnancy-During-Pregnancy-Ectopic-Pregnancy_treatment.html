<h2>What Operation Will I Need For An Ectopic Pregnancy?</h2>
<p>The operation is called a laparoscopy. It is an operation where a fine telescope is inserted near the belly button into your tummy. This allows your doctor to visualise the pelvic organs and the ectopic pregnancy in the fallopian tube.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when there is massive bleeding, a laparotomy may be required. This involves a larger cut in your tummy to perform the operation.</p>
<p>Do not worry about pain from the operation as it is done while you are asleep under general anaesthesia.</p>
<h2>Treatment Of An Ectopic Pregnancy</h2>
<p>The treatment of an ectopic pregnancy is usually surgery. Depending on the severity of the ectopic pregnancy and your fertility requirement, your doctor will discuss the options of keeping or removing your fallopian tube with you.</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, additional blood tests and injections or even another surgery is required after your operation for the ectopic pregnancy.</p>
<p>In a small number of selected patients, treatment with injections may be an option.</p>
<h2>Pregnancy After An Ectopic Pregnancy</h2>
<p>If the ectopic pregnancy was treatment without the removal of a tube, a woman still has a reasonable chance for future successful pregnancies.</p>
<p>Removal of a tube may not affect her chances of getting pregnant if the condition of the other unaffected tube is good.</p>
<p>A woman who had an ectopic pregnancy is at a slightly increased risk for another ectopic pregnancy. Hence, she should speak with her gynaecologist about her risk and the measures for early evaluation of her next pregnancy.</p>
<h2>Where Can I Seek Treatment?</h2>
<p>KK Women's &amp; Children's Hospital provides round the clock service at its O&amp;G 24-Hour Clinic located at Basement 1. There will be a specialist on duty to attend to women with symptoms suggestive of ectopic pregnancy.</p>
