            Treatment</span></h2>
            <p>Anyone with nasal polyps should stop smoking. Early polyps may be treated with oral or nasal medications. Other medications may include antihistamines or antibiotics to treat a chronic or recurring infection. <br>
            <br>
            Surgery may be necessary if medication does not shrink or eliminate the polyps, or if there is suspicion of cancerous growths. The type of surgery will depend on the extent as well as the size of the polyps. <br>
            <br>
            Generally, surgery is in the form of endoscopic surgery. The surgery is usually performed under general anaesthesia and involves the use of a scope inserted into the nose to help the surgeon as he guides small instruments into the nostril and sinus cavities to remove the polyps, and clear any obstruction which may prevent the flow of secretions from the sinuses. <br>
            <br>
            After surgery, your doctor may recommend the use of nasal steroids to prevent the recurrence of polyps as well as nasal washes to prevent the accumulation of dried mucus or crusting in the nose.</p>
