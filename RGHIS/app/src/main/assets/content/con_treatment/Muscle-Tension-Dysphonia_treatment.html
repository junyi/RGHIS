            Treatment</span></h2>
            <p>Typically treatment is multi-faceted, and involves correcting all underlying causes. Speech therapy may be necessary to improve voicing techniques and overcome bad vocal habits which put unnecessary strain on the voice. Often lifestyle changes are necessary including dietary changes and stress reduction. Avoiding unnecessary voice use can sometimes allow the voice muscles to relax and rest. Medication to treat acid reflux may also be prescribed. <br>

            Spasmodic dysphonia is a specific condition that can produce similar symptoms to muscle tension dysphonia, in particular strained voice. Careful diagnosis is required to distinguish these conditions as botulinum toxin injection may be helpful in spasmodic dysphonia. <br>
