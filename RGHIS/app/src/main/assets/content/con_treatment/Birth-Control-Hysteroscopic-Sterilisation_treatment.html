<h2>How Is Hysteroscopic Sterilisation Done?</h2>
<p>Hysteroscopic sterilisation is carried out with a small telescopic instrument called the hysteroscope. This is introduced into your womb to see the opening into your fallopian tubes.</p>
<p>A small flexible micro-coil is then placed in each fallopian tube to block the fallopian tubes thus preventing the sperm from reaching the egg.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>To enable the procedure to be carried out smoothly, you will be given some medication before the operation.</p>
<p>Throughout the operation, you will be able to see the procedures on the video monitor if you choose to.</p>
<h2>After The Procedure</h2>
<h2>Discomfort</h2>
<p>You may feel some cramps in the lower abdomen. This can be relieved with some pain-killer medication that will be provided.</p>
<h2>Vaginal Bleeding</h2>
<p>Some mild vaginal bleeding is expected. Bleeding between your normal menses may occur.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Depending on how you feel, you may be able to get back to your normal activities immediately after the procedure.</p>
<h2>Other Investigation</h2>
<p>Pelvic X-rays may be ordered to confirm the position of the coil in the fallopian tube. A special X-ray called the hystero-salpingogram (HSG), will also be required 3 months after the procedure to confirm that your tubes are totally blocked.</p>
<h2>Sexual Activity</h2>
<p>As the fallopian tube takes up to 3 months to be totally blocked, you will be advised to use an alternative contraception for this period of time. Sexual activity can then be resumed without any interruption</p>
<h2>Follow-up Appointment</h2>
<p>A follow-up appointment will be made in 3 months' time. This is to check that you are well after the hysteroscopic sterilisation as well as to confirm that you are effectively sterilised. </p>
<p>Consult your doctor if you experience:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Severe abdominal pain </li>
    <li>Heavy vaginal bleeding </li>
    <li class=last>Fever above 38 В°C </li>
</ul>
