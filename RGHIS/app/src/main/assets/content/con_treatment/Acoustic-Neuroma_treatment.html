            Treatment</span></h2>
            <p>Very large tumours causing severe brain compression require surgical treatment. Smaller tumours can be treated by radiation. </p>
            <p><strong>Surgical Treatment <br>
            </strong><br>
            This is carried out by the neurosurgeon, and sometimes in conjunction with the  using microsurgical technique. </p>
            <p>There are basically three surgical approaches: <strong>Retrosigmoid, Tranlabyrinthine, and Middle Fossa</strong>. Combinations of these approaches may be used for very large tumours. The choice of the approach will depend on the size and location of the tumour, whether the patient still has good hearing and the medical fitness of the patient. </p>
            <p>Fat or muscle may also be harvested from the abdomen or thigh during surgery to assist with the closure. </p>
            <p>Post-operatively, the patient will usually spend one to several days in the intensive care unit for close monitoring and treatment.</p>
            <p><strong>Risks and Complications of surgery <br>
            </strong><br>
            Possible complications from surgery are similar for all brain surgeries. These include infection, bleeding, death, coma, stroke and seizures. The likelihood of serious complications is fairly low in modern neurosurgical centres. <br>
            <br>
            Other complications specific to acoustic neuroma surgery include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Total hearing loss in the affected ear. </li>
                <li>Tinnitus (ear noise) usually remains after surgery even despite total hearing loss. </li>
                <li>Facial Weakness or Paralysis.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The surgeon has to manipulate and dissect the tumour off the nerve, or sometimes to remove a portion of this nerve. Nerve damage or swelling may occur and cause weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles. This results in incomplete eye closure and sagging of the face. The exposed cornea is dry and easily injured by dust particles. To protect it, the eyelids have to be taped together after instillation of eyedrops. Area inside the inner ear canal where acoustic neuroma usually grows from. A small surgical procedure called tarsorrhaphy (stitching together of the edges of the outer third of the eyelids) may be advised later to protect the eye. Nerve regeneration may occur if the nerve is still anatomically intact after surgery. <br>
            <br>
            However, this is a slow process and it may take up to a year for some recovery of facial movement to be seen. If no recovery is visible after one year, a second operation may be considered to connect the healthy portion of the Facial Nerve to the Hypoglossal Nerve leading to that side of the tongue. This procedure is called Hypoglossal-Facial Nerve anastomosis and restores some, but not perfect, facial functions. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Double vision may occur after removal of a large tumour pressing on one of the cranial nerves (usually the sixth) which control the muscles that move the eye. </li>
                <li>Facial Numbness can develop after removal of a large tumour pressing on the Trigeminal Nerve. </li>
                <li>Swallowing, Throat, Voice Problems, Taste Disturbance, Mouth Dryness may occur after the elimination of a large tumour pressing on the ninth and tenth cranial nerves. </li>
                <li>Balance Problems. The vestibular portion of the eighth nerve is removed during surgery and dizziness is common following surgery. As the balance system in the normal ear compensates for this loss, unsteadiness should improve but may never be perfect. Unsteadiness may therefore occur when the person is tired.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Radiation Treatment <br>
            </strong><br>
            Radiation treatment is carried out using the Novalis Shaped-Beam machine located at the NNI-Khoo Teck Puat Radiosurgery Suite at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Level B1, Block 2. This delivers narrow beams of strong radiation aimed precisely at the tumour from many different directions. Normal brain tissue therefore receives only a fraction of the total radiation dose received by the tumour. Exact knowledge of the tumour location is necessary, and this is achieved by securing the head firmly but painless in a custom made mask system and doing a CT scan of the head with the mask system in place. For treatment planning a MRI scan of the head is also required. </p>
