            <p>Hypothyroidism is treated with hormone replacement, using a synthetic thyroid hormone pill (thyroxine) that aims to regulate thyroid hormone levels and normalise your metabolism. Do note that there may be some trial and error before arriving at the right dose. Your doctor will typically start you on a low dose, to be increased as necessary, if the symptoms persist or blood tests still show abnormal levels. You will be put on medication for life, and have to see your doctor regularly to check your thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, to ensure that the treatment is not causing hyperthyroidism.</p>
