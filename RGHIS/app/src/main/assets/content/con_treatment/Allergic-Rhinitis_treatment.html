            Treatment</span></h2>
            <p>Treatment of allergic rhinitis is aimed mainly at reducing the severity and frequency of attacks. Methods of management can be divided into : <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Environmental Control. <br>
            </strong>Changes to the living environment will have to be made to avoid the allergens that trigger attacks. For example, frequent cleaning of living areas and replacing items such as carpets or stuffed toys may reduce the amount of exposure to dust mites in the house.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Medical Therapy. <br>
            </strong>Medical therapy is directed at controlling symptoms and reducing the allergic response. In cases where symptoms are intermittent, antihistamines may be prescribed. Where attacks are frequent, a nasal steroid may also be added. Nasal steroids are widely used because they are effective for long-term control of symptoms and are safe for long-term use as they have a topical action and very little of the steroid actually gets absorbed by the body. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Immunotherapy. <br>
            </strong>It is also suitable for a select group of people with severe, prolonged symptoms that do not respond to conventional therapy. In immunotherapy, the bodyв„ўs immune system is modulated to reduce the response to the allergen, thus reducing the severity of symptoms. This is a slow process and will require injections or self-administered drops taken regularly over a period of one to three years.</p>
