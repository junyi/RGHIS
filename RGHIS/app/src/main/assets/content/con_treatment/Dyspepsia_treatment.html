            <p>If the ulcer is caused by aspirin or NSAID's, your doctor would definitely ask you to stop these drugs and you would be given acid reducing agents ( cimetidine, famotidine, ranitidine, omeprazole, lansoprazole ) which cut acid productions and accelerate ulcer healing process. If your ulcer is related to Helicobacter pylori, your doctor would give triple therapy ( three drugs) to eradicate the bacteria. Generally, triple therapy can eradicate successfully in up to 90% of cases. Triple therapy consists of one acid reducing agents ( generally of the stronger group such as omeprazole or lansoprazole ) and two antibiotics taken for one week. Common sideeffects are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea which are generally mild. Severe sideeffects are kidney failure and inflammation of the large bowel. Fortunately, severe sideeffects are very uncommon. </p>
            <p>Smoking and alcohol have also been shown to impair ulcer healing. These should be stopped if possible. Foods such as chilli, sour foods, coffee do not predispose a person to peptic ulcer disease, nor do they interfere with ulcer healing.</p>
