<h2>What treatment is there for Epiretinal Membrane (Macular Pucker)?<br>
 </h2>
An epiretinal membrane may be treated with a vitrectomy, a form of keyhole surgery that uses small probes to enter inside the eye to remove the vitreous and peel off the epiretinal membrane. A gas is then injected into the eye to replace the vitreous and prevent it from pulling on the retina. Following surgery, the patient will need to lie in a face-down position for one to two days to allow the gas bubble to press against the macula to smoothen it. The eye will refill naturally with fluid. Eyes with epiretinal membrane which are long standing may not be treated with surgery if the vision is unlikely to improve after surgery. Some epiretinal membranes may present in the early stages which are less serious. They may just be followed up by an ophthalmologist. <br>
<br>
The success of improving the vision varies from person to person and ranges from 80 to 90 per cent. In the majority of eyes, the surgery improves the symptoms of blurred or distorted vision.<br>
