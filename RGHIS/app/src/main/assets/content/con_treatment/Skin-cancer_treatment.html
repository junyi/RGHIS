            <br>
            The main stay of treatment is excision with adequate wide margin. If the skin defect is large after excision, skin graft may be required. Mohâ€™s microsurgery is a microscopically guided way to remove skin cancer. Other forms of treatment include cryotherapy (freezing with liquid nitrogen) and curettage and electrosurgery, photodynamic therapy and radiation therapy. FDA has approved imiquimod cream to treat superficial BCC and SCC. Metastasis of melanoma can be treated with interferon alpha-2b, interleukin 2 and chemotherapy.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Prognosis of Skin Cancer<br>
            </strong><br>
            The prognosis depends on the histologic type of the malignant cell, tumour size, depth of the tumour, location of the tumour and the presence of metastases. Excision with adequate wide margin can promise a cure for most of the early skin cancers. There are guidelines to the excision margin of the various skin cancers. The early detection of skin cancer cannot be overemphasized. The prognosis for thick melanoma with wide spread metastasis is grave. All patients should be followed up to detect local recurrence, metastases and additional skin cancers. </p>
            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Prevention</span> </h2>
            Ultraviolent radiation from the sun is the most important risk factor of melanoma and NMSC. Sun avoidance and the use of sun protection devices such as hats, umbrella, clothing and sunscreen should be started from young. Self-examination and awareness can help early detection of skin cancer.
