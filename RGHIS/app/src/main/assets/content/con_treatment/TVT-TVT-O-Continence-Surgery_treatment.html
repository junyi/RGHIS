<h2>What You Need To Do Prior To Surgery </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Blood tests, heart tracing (ECG) and chest X-ray may be done to ensure that you are in optimal health. </li>
    <li>You may be given oral or vaginal oestrogen (hormone) if you are near or already menopausal. It is important to comply with this medication as it thickens your vaginal tissues for easy surgery and faster healing. </li>
    <li>All your medications and medical conditions, if any, must be made known to the doctor and must be optimally controlled. </li>
    <li>If you are on aspirin, please let us know. You have to stop taking it a week prior to the surgery. </li>
    <li>You will not be allowed to eat or drink after midnight on the day before surgery. </li>

<h2>What You Can Expect In The Operating Theatre</h2>
<p>The TVT / TVT-O continence surgery is usually done under regional or general anaesthesia (i.e. where you will be asleep throughout the operation). You may discuss it with the anaesthetist.</p>
<p>The TVT operation involves two small incisions of 0.5 cm each on your lower abdomen below your pubic hairline and a 1.5 cm incision on your anterior vaginal skin. The TVT tape is inserted below your urethra into the abdominal wound. The operation takes about 15 minutes. At the end of the surgery, a urinary catheter may be inserted into your bladder to allow free urine flow. A vaginal pack may be inserted as well.</p>
<p>The TVT-O tape is inserted through the same 1.5 cm anterior vaginal wall incision; but has two 0.5 cm incisions in the groin area instead.</p>
<h2>What Happens After The Operation?</h2>
<ol>
    <li>After the operation, you may experience:
    <ul>
        <li>Nausea and occasional vomiting - You should rest and medication will be given to relieve these symptoms. </li>
        <li>Pain from the wound - This is usually mild and you will be given painkillers. </li>
        <li class=last>Post-operative care - You should rest and gradually increase your movement. The physiotherapist can help if necessary. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If you are given regional anaesthesia, a 6-hour bed rest is recommended before you are allowed to get out of bed. After that, you are encouraged to move around. </li>
    <li>You will be allowed to drink and eat on the same day of operation. </li>
    <li>The vaginal pack, if any, will be removed the next day. </li>
    <li>The urinary catheter, if any, will be removed later on the same day or on the next day. You will be encouraged to void on your own. The volume of the remaining urine will be measured. If you can void adequately, you will be allowed to go home. 6. You are advised not to engage in sexual activity, drive or douch your vagina for a month after surgery. </li>
    <li>You are advised not to carry heavy weights (of more than 5 kg) in the long run after surgery. </li>

        <li>Severe vaginal bleeding </li>
