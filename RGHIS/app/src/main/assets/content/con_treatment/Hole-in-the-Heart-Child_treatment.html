<p>If there is suspicion of a structural heart defect, the baby is referred to the paediatric cardiologist for evaluation.</p>
<h2>Is It Possible To Miss A Heart Defect In The First Month Of Life?</h2>
<p>Yes, that is possible because some remain asymptomatic, while others have murmurs which become more obvious after 3 to 6 weeks of life. </p>
<p>But because most infants are reviewed by doctors for immunisation and developmental assessment in the first year of life, significant congenital heart defects are rarely left undiagnosed in Singapore. By the time they are in school, the majority of patients picked up by the school health team for heart murmurs have structurally normal hearts. </p>
<h2>What Tests Can Be Done To Make A Diagnosis?</h2>
<p>The paediatric cardiologist can often tell by examination whether a heart murmur is significant. The simple tests include a chest X-ray and an electrocardiogram. The chest X-ray is used to tell the shape and size of the heart and the state of the lungs. An electrocardiogram analyses the electrical activity of the heart. If the clinical electrocardiogram and simple investigation is normal, we stop at that and reassure the parents. </p>
<p>If there is suspicion, an electrocardiogram is ordered. This is an ultrasound examination of the heart, like what the obstetrician will perform to look at the fetus in pregnant women.</p>
<h2>Can The Defect Be Detected Before The Child Is Born?</h2>
<p>Yes and no. The heart is formed by the eighth week of pregnancy. Antenatal ultrasound can be used to look at the heart at about 12 weeks onwards to look for heart defects. The majority of heart defects picked up antenatally are major and often serious abnormalities of the heart. Minor defects like small holes and mild valve defects, for example, will slip through this screening process.</p>
<h2>What Are The Options If A Defect Is Diagnosed Antenatally?</h2>
<p>The defect has to be carefully characterised and the type of treatment that is available and the long term outcome of treatment will have to be discussed with the parents. Depending on the type of defect, the stage of pregnancy, the philosophy of parents, their religious beliefs and family support, a decision is made to carry on to term or to terminate the pregnancy.</p>
<h2>If The Child Has A Hole In The Heart, What Kind Of Medical Treatments Would The Doctor Recommend?</h2>
<p>Not all heart defects need specific treatment. For example, if the child has a small hole in the heart such as a ventricular septal defect, no treatment is necessary. The child should be treated like any normal child and allowed normal physical activities. Most of these holes become smaller with time and some may close spontaneously. There is a small risk of bacterial infection of the area around the hole because of flow turbulence. Patients are advised to have good dental care, and if they were to undergo dental or surgical procedures, to take a prophylactic course of antibiotics to prevent bacteria from seeping into the blood and infecting the heart. </p>
<p>For significant defects, for example a moderate to large ventricular septal defect, the baby can present with heart failure -- the signs of which include poor feeding, breathlessness and poor weight gain. We treat these babies with medication. Some improve as the defect becomes smaller over time. Others who do not improve with medical treatment are referred to the heart surgeon to close the defect surgically.</p>
<h2>How Long Will The Recovery Process Be?</h2>
<p>The majority of patients who undergo surgery for ventricular septal defects are babies in the first year of life. The child usually goes home from the hospital within 10 to 12 days.</p>
<h2>Under What Circumstances Will A Hole In The Heart Close Spontaneously?</h2>
<p>Small ventricular septal defects have a good chance of closing spontaneously. The closure rate is estimated to be in the range of 30% to 50% and occurs most frequently in the first year of life.</p>
<h2>What Are The Symptoms Of An Adult With A Hole In The Heart?</h2>
<p>Most adults with small or minor defects have no symptoms and lead a perfectly normal life. Some are detected because the doctor detected a heart murmur on routine examination. While others may have complications of significant defects like breathlessness on physical exertions.</p>
<h2>What Is Normally Done For Adults?</h2>
<p>This would depend on type and severity of the defect. If the defect is significant and surgery is deemed to improve the quality of life, surgery will be offered to these patients.</p>
<h2>What Kind Of Complications Can Occur With Holes In The Heart?</h2>
<p>The complications that arise depend on the type of defect, site of defect in relation to vital heart structures and size of fetus. Let's talk about the ventricular septal defect as an example. A large defect can result in heart failure with failure to gain weight, recurrent respiratory infections and damage to the blood vessels in the lungs. A defect near the left outlet valve can result in damage to the valve and subsequent valve leakage. As mentioned before there is also risk of infection of the heart.</p>
