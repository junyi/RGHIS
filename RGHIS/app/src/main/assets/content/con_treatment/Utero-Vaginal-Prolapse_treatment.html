<h2>What Forms Of Treatment Are Available?</h2>
<h2>Non-Surgical Treatment</h2>
<p>Once utero-vaginal prolapse has occurred, spontaneous recovery is not possible. There are many different types of vaginal pessaries available which can be inserted into the vagina to support the prolapse and temporarily relieve the symptoms. This type of treatment is not a cure and is used in cases when surgery is not suitable. Regular examinations are necessary to change the pessary and to check for complications such as ulceration or bleeding. Any aggravating factors such as chronic cough will need to be treated. You may be prescribed an estrogen containing cream to apply to the vagina if you are menopausal.</p>
<h2>Surgical Treatment</h2>
<p>Surgery is curative for utero-vaginal prolapse. The principles of surgery are to correct the supportive defects and restore the normal anatomy and sexual function. This may include removal of the uterus (hysterectomy), hitching up the bladder or vagina, or repair and 'tightening' of the vagina. Depending on the condition, surgery may be performed either through the vagina or through the abdomen. Your doctor will be able to discuss with you and advise you on the appropriate surgery.</p>
