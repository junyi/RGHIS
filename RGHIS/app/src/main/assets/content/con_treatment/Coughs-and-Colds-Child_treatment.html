<h2>A Final Word</h2>
<p>Use OTC drugs conservatively. Many cough and cold medications have exaggerated and sometimes, paradoxical effects on children. Most coughs and colds clear up without any treatment. Many non-drug approaches such as adequate fluid intake, a well-balanced diet and keeping away from air-conditioned areas provide equal or better relief from the symptoms compared to drugs.</p>
<p>Always consult your doctor or the pharmacist when in doubt before administering any OTC drugs.</p>
