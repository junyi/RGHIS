            <p>The treatment of specific valvular heart disease will vary, depending on the valve involved and the extent of damage or malfunction. Some patients will not require any specific treatment and many can be treated with medications. Sometimes, patients need surgery. If multi-valvular disease is suspected, the different valves may be evaluated during surgery on one of the affected valves. Women with heart valve disease and want to become pregnant should receive a thorough check-up and see a cardiologist regularly throughout their pregnancy. </p>
            <p><strong>Infective endocarditis<br>
            </strong>Depending on the type of bacterium that caused the disease, an appropriate antibiotic or combination of antibiotics will be used to treat infective endocarditis. Severe cases may be corrected by valve replacement surgery.</p>
            <p><strong>Rheumatic fever</strong><br>
            Patients with rheumatic fever will be treated with antibiotics to eliminate streptococcal organisms that may still remain in the heart. Patients may receive antibiotics to prevent further infection, and inflammation may be treated with aspirin or cortisone-like drugs.</p>
