            <p><strong>Is surgery necessary?</strong></p>
            <p>Few chronic subdural haematomas heal themselves over time. They often require surgery, particularly in the case of significant brain compression, neurological problems, seizures or chronic headaches. <br>
            <br>
            Since the blood is in a liquefied state, surgery is usually carried out by drilling two small holes (burr-hole) in the skull to allow blood to be drained away. Solid blood clots may need to be removed through a larger opening (craniotomy) in the skull.One or two drains are usually placed to drain blood and fluid from the operation site to prevent recollection.<br>
            <br>
            Post surgery, the patient will be transferred back to the ward for monitoring and nursed flat in bed during the immediate post-operative period to allow the brain to re-expand. <br>
            <br>
            On the second day after operation, the drain will be removed and patient will be able to sit up in bed or walk about as tolerated. </p>
            <p><strong>What is the long term outcome?</strong></p>
            <p>Some chronic subdural haematomas return after drainage, and repeat surgery may be necessary.<br>
            <br>
            Most people can be discharged after 5-7 days post operatively. Eventually, the person is able to resume normal activities. Those with significant preoperative disability may need to undergo a period of rehabilitation. </p>
