            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Diagnosis </span></h2>
            <p>The condition can be diagnosed by your doctor. To demonstrate the prolapse, patients may be asked to &quot;strain&quot; as if having a bowel movement or to sit on the commode and &quot;strain&quot; prior to examination. </p>
            <p>For earlier stages, an x-ray examination may be needed for the diagnosis. X-ray pictures are taken while the patient is having a bowel movement. The X-rays also help your doctor in deciding whether surgery is useful and which operation is suitable.</p>
            <p>Anorectal manometry may also be used. This test measures the strength of the muscles of the anus.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Treatment</span></h2>
            <p>Just treating the constipation and straining may not be enough once rectal prolapse has occurred. There are different types of surgery for rectal prolapse. Your doctor will help you decide which method is most suited for you. <br>
            <br>
            Success depends on a few factors, including the strength of the anal muscles before surgery, the stage of the prolapse, the overall health of the patient and the type of surgery. A great majority of patients are completely relieved of symptoms, or are significantly helped, by the appropriate procedure.</p>
