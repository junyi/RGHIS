            <p>Two main areas where positive action can make a difference to IBS are your lifestyle and diet. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure that you have sufficient leisure time and regular exercise </li>
                <li>Eat a healthy and well balanced diet. Make sure you drink enough fluid and fibre or roughage in your diet. Good sources of fibre are wholemeal bread and cereals, potatoes, wholegrain pasta and brown rice and all types of fruit and vegetables. If your symptoms include constipation, eating plenty of fibre and drinking plenty of fluids may be particularly helpful. IBS is not due to food allergy so there is no need to avoid certain foods. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Drugs: if these simple measures do not help your symptoms, your doctor may prescribe you anti spasmodic agents. These drugs help to control your symptoms ( pain and bloating) by relaxing the bowel spasm.</p>
