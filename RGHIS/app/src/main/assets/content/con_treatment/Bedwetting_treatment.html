            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Treatment</span></h2>
            <br>
            With treatment, the majority of children with bedwetting can improve significantly and even overcome it. There are two main treatments for enuresis : <br>
            <strong>1. Medication</strong> (prescribed by a doctor) <br>
            <strong>2. Enuresis alarm</strong> (prescribed by occupational therapists upon a doctorв„ўs referral) <br>
            <br>
            <strong><span style="color:#ff6600">1. Medication ( Desmopressin )</span></strong> <br>
            <br>
            Bedwetting children typically produce large amounts of urine during sleep. To reduce this excessive urine production, the doctor may prescribe a medication called Desmopressin whose action is similar to antidiuretic hormone (ADH) that can reduce the production of urine. Up to 70 percent of children with bedwetting show a good response to this medication. <br>
            <br>
            It is necessary to try out this medication over two weeks to assess the childв„ўs response first as only about 70 percent of children will respond to the medication. If the response is satisfactory, then treatment is continued for at least three months, after which the treatment will need to be reviewed. Some children may need treatment for a longer period of time. <br>
            <br>
            This medication is generally considered safe. However, as it reduces water excretion from the body, it can potentially cause water retention if the child drinks excessively after taking the medication. The excessive water in the body can cause fits which is a major unwanted side-effect. <br>
            <br>
            Fortunately, bedwetting children are 'deep sleepers' and do not wake up to drink water and the effect of the medication usually lasts for eight to nine hours or overnight. By the time the child gets up in the morning, the effect of the medication would have worn off and the child can then resume normal drinking. This side effect has, therefore, very rarely occurred in the treatment of bedwetting. <br>
            <br>
            Precautions such as not drinking water one to two hours before bedtime and not drinking till the child wakes up in the morning are important with the use of this medication. It is also important to remember to discontinue the medication if more water intake is necessary e.g. if the child is febrile or having diarrhoea and vomiting. There may be an occasional occurrence of other minor side effects, which include headaches, loss of appetite and abdominal cramps. <br>
            <br>
            <strong><span style="color:#ff6600">2. Enuresis alarm <br>
            </span></strong><br>
            As bedwetting children are 'deep sleepers' and do not wake up when the bladder is full, enuresis alarm training is targeted at this problem by training the child to wake up when the bladder is full. <br>
            <br>
            The alarm system works like this : When the child starts to wet the bed, a moisture sensor worn by the child sends a signal to trigger the alarm to sound, the alarm wakes the child, who then knows it is time to get up and go to the toilet. Following nights of training the child will eventually be able to recognise a full bladder and the need to wake up to pass urine. <br>
            <br>
            You can usually see some results after one to two weeks of training. The reported success in using the alarm rate is 80-85 percent after two to three months of training.<br>
            <p><strong>How does the occupational therapist help? <br>
            <br>
            </strong>Upon referral from a doctor, the occupational therapist (OT) assesses a childв„ўs suitability for therapy. The OT then teaches the child and family how to use the alarm and set up a therapy program at home. As compliance and motivation are essential for success, the OT will follow-up with the child until he/she has attained dryness. During these follow-up sessions, the OT will work with the child and family to review progress and solve any issues or problems. <br>
            <br>
            Consistent follow-up is critical in attaining dryness. Children who do not have follow-up may lose motivation, resulting in lower compliance and treatment failure. Once dryness is attained, the child will be reviewed by the doctor and discharged from the clinic.</p>
