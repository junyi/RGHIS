            <p><strong>Treatment options at the Pain Management Centre</strong></p>
            <p>Medications are the cornerstone of cancer pain treatment. Depending on your condition, our specialists at the Pain Management Centre may prescribe various combinations of medications such as paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or opioid medications. Additional treatment may include other medications to treat related nerve and bone pain resulting from the cancer or its treatment.</p>
            <p>For severe cancer pain uncontrolled by medications, specialised advanced treatment procedures may be used in suitable patients. These include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Nerve blocks, involving the injection of anaesthetic medication into affected areas </li>
                <li>Spinal infusion of drugs, providing long-term pain control </li>
            </ol>
            <p>There will be extensive discussions with the patient and family prior to the procedures.</p>
            <p>A team of nurses who are specialised in providing care, comfort and support will also support the patients.</p>
            <p>Chronic cancer pain often causes patients significant distress and in severe cases, depression. At the Pain Management Centre, you will also benefit from having a psychologist involved in your care. </p>
            <p>Referrals may also be made to the highly specialised team of Palliative Care physicians and surgeons to provide holistic care to the patients.</p>
