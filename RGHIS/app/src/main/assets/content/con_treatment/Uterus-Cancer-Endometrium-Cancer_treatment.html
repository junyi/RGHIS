            <p><strong>Treatment of Endometrium Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            The mainstay of treatment for uterine cancer is surgical removal of the uterus with fallopian tubes and ovaries as well as the draining lymphatics. It will also allow the doctors to assess the extent of spread of the cancer (stage of the cancer). Following the surgery, additional or adjuvant treatment such as radiotherapy, hormonal treatment or chemotherapy may or may not be required depending on the stage, grade and type of cancer.</p>
            <p><strong>Prognosis of Endometrium Cancer<br>
            </strong><br>
            The overall prognosis of endometrial cancer is good if diagnosed in the early stage.</p>

            Frequently Asked Questions</span></h2>
            <p>Although there may be other reasons that can cause vaginal bleeding, such as cervix infection or trauma, you should seek early medical attention. Many cancers of the uterus and cervix do present with bleeding. If detected and treated early, there is a higher chance of cure.</p>
            <p><strong>I am on hormone replacement therapy. Is there any risk of getting cancer?<br>
            </strong><br>
            Studies show that combined hormone replacement therapy, known as HRT in short (progestin and estrogen) may help menopause symptoms in women who still have a uterus without increasing their risk of endometrial cancer. Before starting, you should ask your doctor, who knows your personal medical history, for the risks and benefits of the therapy.</p>
