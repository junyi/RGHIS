            <br>
            Although a marker in the blood, called CA-125, is raised in about 80% of patients with epithelial ovarian cancers, it is not always accurate and not adequate for diagnosis of ovarian cancer. It is also raised in non-cancerous conditions, such as endometriosis and appendicitis. The result of elevated CA-125 must therefore be interpreted in the light of other clinical findings. Pelvic ultrasound can help to detect abnormal ovarian cysts. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis and chest x-rays are also useful in detecting whether are areas of the body is affected. Ultimately an operation or biopsy is required to prove that the cells affected are cancerous and originated from the ovaries.</p>

            <p><strong>Treatment of Ovarian Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            To determine the actual extent of the cancer, surgical exploration or staging is required. During the procedure, the doctor will examine the peritoneum, which is the inner lining of the abdomen. Fluid within the abdomen is sent for assessment which involves analysis under a microscope. Besides determining the stage of the cancer, the aim of surgery is to remove as much of the cancer as possible. Often this includes removing ovaries, the uterus and its surrounding lymphatics.</p>
            <p>Additional treatment following surgery will be determined by the stage of the disease, the grade of the disease (aggressiveness) and the type of cancer.</p>
            <p>For very early stage disease and non-aggressive types, further treatment may not be required. For the more advanced and aggressive types of cancers, chemotherapy is the treatment of choice.</p>
            <p><strong>Prognosis of Ovarian Cancer<br>
            </strong><br>
            Ovarian cancer in the early stage can potentially be cured while those in the late stage of the cancer, permanent cure maybe difficult.</p>
