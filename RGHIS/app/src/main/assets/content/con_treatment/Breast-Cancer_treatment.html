            <p><strong>Treatment of Breast Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            <strong>Surgery</strong> is the usual initial treatment of breast cancer. A desirable aim of surgical treatment is to conserve the breast if possible, and this involves removing the cancer with the safest minimal amount of surrounding tissue (i.e. wide excision). </p>
            <p>There are some patients where this is not possible and <strong>total removal of the affected breast and underlying muscles</strong>, (i.e. mastectomy), is required. The lymph glands under the armpit may be entirely removed at the time of surgery. (i.e. axillary clearance) or, alternatively, a dye may be injected into the region of the primary tumour to determine the most informative single gland to remove (sentinel mode sampling). This is important to predict how likely the cancer will recur.</p>
            <p><strong>Radiotherapy</strong> after surgery may be necessary if it is felt that there may be cancer cells left in the remaining breast tissue which may cause the cancer to recur in the breast a subsequent date, (i.e. local recurrence). Radiotherapy to the chest usually takes place over 5 weeks. Radiotherapy is almost always recommended if only a wide excision of the cancer is performed. </p>
            <p><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> aims to prevent cancer recurrence in tissues distant from the breast. Chemotherapy is usually indicated in younger women and is given over 3 to 6 months. There may be mild nausea or vomiting, hair loss, lethargy or tiredness, and loss of appetite. Most women can continue working during this period. The choice of recommended drugs will depend on the person's general health and other medical problems, stage of cancer, and other risk factors.</p>
            <p>Some breast cancers have special protein receptors on the cancer cells, such as oestrogen and progesterone receptors, and Her-2neu receptor. Patients whose breast cancers have oestrogen or progesterone receptors are more likely to benefit from additional hormonal treatment. For patients with advanced breast cancer where the cancer has Her-2neu receptors, an antibody to the her-2-neu has been developed for therapeutic use. Studies with the Her-2neu antibody are continuing; because of possible damage to the heart it cannot be considered standard therapy in the adj(prophylae)setting yet.</p>
            <p>Sometimes chemotherapy is given before surgery in order to shrink the breast cancer before surgery. This is usually the case if the breast cancer was especially large.</p>
            <p>In older women who have reached menopause, cheomotherapy may not always be necessary; only hormones such as tamoxifen may be required. This is so if the cancer was oestrogen or progesterone receptor positive. </p>
            <p><strong>Advanced Breast Cancer<br>
            </strong><br>
            Breast cancer may spread to the lungs, liver, bones or brain, either at the time of diagnosis or years after the original breast cancer has been removed. Treatment options include hormone treatment, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. </p>
            <p><strong>Prognosis of Breast Cancer<br>
            </strong><br>
            Prognosis means the probable future outcome of an illness based upon the relevant facts of the case. All findings from clinical examination and investigations and pathology reports are important and must be considered together to decided the prognosis of an individual case of breast cancer. </p>
            The doctor looks for the following features:
            <ul>
                <li>The size of the breast cancer is important. In general, the larger the cancer, the more likely the cancer will recur. The size of the breast cancer also influences whether breast conservation is an option. </li>
                <li>How many of the lymph glands in the armpit were involved? The more lymph glands involved, the more likely the cancer will recur. </li>
                <li>Did the pathologist see high risk features such as involvement of the blood vessels or lymph channels in the resected specimen? Were the cancerous cells mature or immature?   </li>
            </ul>
