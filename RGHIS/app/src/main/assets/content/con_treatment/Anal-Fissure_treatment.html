            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Treatment</span></h2>
            <p>At least 50 percent of fissures heal by themselves without need for an operation. Application of special medicated cream, use of stool softeners, avoidance of constipation, and the use of sitz baths (soaking the anal area in plain warm water for 20 minutes, several times a day) help to relieve the symptoms and allow healing to occur.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Frequently Asked Questions</span> </h2>
            <p><em><strong>What if a fissure does not heal? <br>
            </strong></em><br>
            A fissure that does not heal should be reexamined to determine if an underlying problem that prevents healing exists. This could be due to scarring or muscle spasm of the internal anal sphincter muscle. Those which continue to cause pain and/or bleeding can be corrected by surgery. <br>
            <strong><em>  <br>
            What happens during the surgery? <br>
            </em><br>
            </strong>Surgery consists of a small operation to cut a portion of the anal muscle. This helps the fissure to heal by preventing pain and spasm, which interferes with healing. Cutting this muscle rarely interferes with the ability to control bowel movements. Some surgeons may also remove the fissure and the underlying scar tissue. <br>
              <br>
            Most patients can go home the same day or next day. Complete healing occurs in a few weeks, although pain often disappears after a few days. <br>
            <strong><em>  <br>
            Will the problem return? <br>
            </em><br>
            </strong>More than 90% of patients who require surgery for this problem have no further trouble from fissures. <br>
            <br>
            <strong><em>Can fissures lead to colon cancer? <br>
            </em><br>
            </strong>No! Persistent symptoms need careful evaluation, however, since conditions other than fissure can cause similar symptoms.</p>
