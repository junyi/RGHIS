<h2>What kinds of treatment are available for Epiblepharon?<br>
 </h2>
Epiblepharon can be mild or severe and the treatment depends on the severity and the presence of corneal damage caused by the constant rubbing of the lashes against the cornea. Some children with mild epiblepharon can grow out of the condition. This occurs with maturation of the facial structures. Mild cases can therefore be treated with lubricating eye drops or ointment. In severe cases, surgery may be required. Surgery involves removing a small area of excess skin and muscle just below the lid margin to help the lashes rotate outwards. There may be a faint line where the incision is made, but this usually becomes less obvious with time as seen in the photos below.<br>
