            Treatment Options</span></h2>
             
            <h2><strong>Treatment of Colon Cancer<br>
            </strong></h2>
            <br>
            <p>The mainstay of treatment is surgery. The cancer, its surrounding fat and lymph glands are removed during surgery. The two ends of the cut section are joined together. If for some reason the colon cannot be joined, an artificial opening for the colon, called a colostomy, may be required. This opening allows waste to be removed from the body when the normal opening cannot be used or has to be removed. A colostomy may be temporary or permanent.  <br>
            <br>
            Depending on the stage of the cancer, chemotherapy may be required after surgery to improve a person's chance of cure from cancer. Chemotherapy involves injections of anti-cancer drugs into a vein on the hand. Chemotherapy, which lasts from 6 to 12 months, is usually associated with mild mouth ulcers, mild diarrhoea, mild hair loss, possible darkening of complexion, and nausea. The commonest medicine used is 5- fluorouracil, though other drugs may be used in addition. </p>
            <p><strong>Treatment of Rectal Cancer<br>
            </strong><br>
            Again, the mainstay of treatment is surgery. Because of the position of the rectum in the bony pelvis, the chance of cancer spreading to the surrounding organs, such as bladder, uterus and bone, is high. Even if the cancer was totally removed by surgery, occasionally there is concern that undetectable cancer cells may lie in the vicinity since the distance between cancer and normal tissue is so short. Hence, depending on how far the cancer has invaded the surrounding fat and organs, radiation therapy is sometimes used to reduce the size of the colorectal cancer before surgery. More often, it is used after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the cancer from recurring. </p>
            <p>Radiotherapy involves giving high-energy rays into a small area where the original cancer was. The course of treatment, given daily for 5 minutes, usually lasts 5 to 6 weeks. Side effects which may occur include diarrhoea, tiredness, skin redness and rash. In some women, radiotherapy brings on early menopause.</p>
            <p>As with colon cancer, chemotherapy may also be required, after surgery. Radiotherapy may be given together with chemotherapy.</p>
            <p><strong>Prognosis of Colorectum Cancer<br>
            </strong><br>
            Prognosis means the probable outcome of an illness based upon all the relevant facts of the case. All findings from clinical examination and x-ray investigations and pathology reports are important and must be considered together to decide what the progress of an individual case of Colorectum cancer may be. From this, the appropriate course of treatment can be decided and put into action. The treatment strategy will vary from person to person. With prompt and appropriate treatment, the outlook for a person with early Colorectum cancer is good.</p>
