            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes</span></h2>
            <p>There may be several causes. A common cause is excessive cleaning of the anal area. Moisture around the anus, from excessive sweating or from moist, sticky stools, is another possible cause. </p>
            <p>In addition, certain beverages, including alcohol, milk, citrus fruit juices and drinks containing caffeine, such as coffee, tea and cola, may aggravate the condition in some people. Likewise, food that may cause problems include chocolate, fruits, tomatoes, nuts and popcorn. Other uncommon cause of pruritus ani may include pinworms, psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, anal infections and allergies.</p>
            <p>Does Pruritus Ani Result From Lack of Cleanliness?<br>
            <br>
            Cleanliness may initially be a factor. However, the natural tendency once a person develops this itching is to wash the area vigorously and frequently with strong soap and a washcloth. This almost always makes the problem worse by damaging the skin and washing away protective natural oils.</p>
