            <p><strong>Symptoms and Signs of Larynx Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            A person should seek early medical attention if he has a persistently hoarse voice or a persistent sore throat, a painless lump in the neck, pain on swallowing, difficulty swallowing, or noisy breathing known as stridor. As cancer can spread to other organs in the body, in the very late stages there may be symptoms from the lungs or bone.</p>

            <p><strong>Diagnostic Tests</strong><br>
            <br>
            If larynx cancer is suspected, the doctor will examine for swelling or lumps in the neck. An angled mirror that faces downwards is placed against the back of the throat (the palate) to examine the voice box and surrounding organs. Or a flexible tube, less than a cm in diameter, is passed into one of the nostrils to the back of the throat to look for lumps or ulcers in the voice box and surrounding areas. </p>
