            <p>Infective endocarditis  Most people with a healthy, normal heart are not at significant risk for contracting this infection of the heart valve. Those who have had rheumatic fever, with resulting scarring, or congenital heart disease, may contract this disease.</p>
            <p>Dental surgery or any surgery involving the mouth, bladder, prostate, or female pelvic organs increases the risk for this infection. The disease also may occur in drug addicts who inject drugs into their veins using unsterilised needles, even if they have normal heart valves.</p>
            <p>Patients who have developed the disease may report fever, fatigue, night sweats, chills, and joint inflammation. </p>
            <p>In patients where the disease has developed more slowly, symptoms may include signs of rapid heart rate, an enlarged spleen, various skin rashes or spots, and heart murmur. </p>
            <p>Rheumatic fever  This results from an allergic response to certain types of streptococcal bacteria. If it occurs, it is most often in children who have had streptococcal infections that were not completely treated.</p>
            <p>Chronic rheumatic heart disease can result from just one occurrence or repeated attacks of rheumatic fever.</p>
            <p>The symptoms of rheumatic fever include fever, joint pains, and either lumps under the skin or raised red patches on the skin.</p>
            <p>Other valvular heart disease  With ageing, deposits of calcium can lead to thickening and leakage of heart valves. Heart attacks can also damage the mitral valve structures, and certain connective tissue disorders such as Marfans syndrome and myxomatous degeneration, can also adversely affect the heart valves.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Diagnosis<a class=ms-asset-internalBookmark id=Diagnosis title=Diagnosis> </a></span></h2>
            <p>Specific types of valvular heart disease are diagnosed using electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, certain x-ray studies, and / or cardiac catheterisation.</p>
            <p><strong>Infective endocarditis</strong><br>
            A diagnosis can be obtained through history, physical examination, lab tests, ECG and echocardiogram.</p>
            <p><strong>Rheumatic fever</strong><br>
            Rheumatic fever may be suspected following a recent throat infection. Symptoms include joint ache, abnormal electrocardiogram or heart inflammation as indicated in a blood test. Heart murmurs may be detected from routine examination.</p>
