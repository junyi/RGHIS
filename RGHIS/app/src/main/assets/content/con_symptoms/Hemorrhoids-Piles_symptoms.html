            <p>The symptoms of piles can mimic and mask the symptoms of cancer. It is important for any patient complaining of symptoms that might be attributed to piles to consult their specialist surgeon for a full examination, before dismissing their symptoms as mild and haemorrhoid related.</p>
            <p>Some signs and symptoms that patients can look out for include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bleeding at times other than defecation </li>
                <li>Sensation of incomplete emptying that is present all the time, despite defecation </li>
                <li>Change in the calibre and character of the stools </li>
                <li>Change in bowel habits </li>
                <li>Obvious hard mass at the anus </li>
                <li>Unexplained loss of appetite and weight  </li>
            </ul>
            </div>
