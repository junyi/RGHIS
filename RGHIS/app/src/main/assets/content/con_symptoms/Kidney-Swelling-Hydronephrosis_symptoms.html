            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>In unborn babies, this condition can be diagnosed by an ultrasound scan of the expecting mother. Hydronephrosis does not usually aff ect the pregnancy, and the delivery should proceed as planned. The condition will then be confi rmed by a repeat ultrasound of the babys kidney on the second or third day of life. On an ultrasound the kidney tissue may be distended and squashed, and the urine drainage system will appear very ballooned and dilated. </p>

            Symptoms</span></h2>
            <p>If hydronephrosis is left undiagnosed and untreated, some children will present with a large stomach bulge and perhaps pain, from a huge, swollen kidney. Often when picked up at this stage, there is not much kidney function left in that kidney. The other kidney is usually normal. </p>
