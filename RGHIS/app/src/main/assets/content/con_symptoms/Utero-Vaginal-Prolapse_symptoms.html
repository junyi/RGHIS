<h2>What Are The Symptoms Of Utero-Vaginal Prolapse?</h2>
<p>Some women with a very mild degree of prolapse may not have any symptoms at all. However most women with significant prolapse may experience some of the followings:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dragging sensation or discomfort in the lower abdomen or pelvis </li>
    <li>Sensation of swelling or fullness in the vagina </li>
    <li>Backache </li>
    <li>Vaginal discharge or bleeding </li>
    <li>Difficulty in passing motion or urine </li>
    <li class=last>Urinary symptoms which include passing urine more frequently, a sensation of incomplete emptying of the bladder or leakage of urine during coughing, sneezing and straining. </li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the above symptoms are relieved when lying down. The symptoms are worse in the evening and better in the morning.</p>

<h2>How Can It Be Prevented?</h2>
<p>Prevention may not always be successful. However certain measures can be taken to reduce the chances of developing utero-vaginal prolapse, or to prevent a prolapse from getting worse.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>In pregnancy:</strong> Pelvic floor exercises. (Your doctor may be able to advise you on this, or refer you to a physiotherapist). </li>
    <li><strong>During labour:</strong> Avoid bearing down (pushing) before the cervix is fully dilated </li>
    <li><strong>After delivery:</strong> Avoid bearing down efforts and constipation. Continue pelvic floor exercises early. </li>
    <li class=last><strong>After menopause:</strong> Hormone replacement may be helpful. (Your doctor will be able to advise you on this). Avoid prolonged standing, heavy lifting and chronic cough. Restart pelvic floor exercises daily. </li>
</ul>
<h2>What Are The Complications If Left Untreated? </h2>
<p>These are generally preventable and occur only with longstanding untreated cases of moderate or severe utero-vaginal prolapse.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ulceration and infection of the cervical and vaginal skin </li>
    <li>Bleeding of the lower tract </li>
    <li>Thickening of the skin of the cervix </li>
    <li>Obstruction to urine flow and retention of urine leading to back pressure effects on the kidneys </li>
    <li>Urinary tract infection </li>
    <li class=last>Worsening prolapse </li>
</ul>
<h2>What Can I Expect During The Examination?</h2>
<p>In order for the gynaecologist to advise you on the management of your condition, it will be necessary to take a detailed history and make a proper assessment of the degree of prolapse. This will involve an examination with you lying on your side and then on your back. You may be asked to cough and to bear down. Computerised testing of the bladder may also be performed to test for urinary leakage.</p>
