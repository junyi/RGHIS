            <br>
            Generally, an Orthopaedic consult would include radiological investigations. Your surgeon will order the appropriate x-rays. <br>
            <br>
            Occasionally specialised investigations like Computer-Tomography (CT) scans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or ultrasound scans may be needed. Some investigations are better meant to look at the bones and joints, and others to look at the soft tissues. Sometimes, you may be required to undergo some blood tests to rule out especially, inflammatory arthritis. </div>
