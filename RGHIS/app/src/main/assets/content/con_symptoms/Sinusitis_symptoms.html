            Symptoms</span></h2>
            <p>Symptoms of sinusitis include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Difficulty breathing through the nose </li>
                <li>Fever </li>
                <li>Throbbing pain in the cheek, forehead area between the eyes </li>
                <li>Sensation of heaviness in the head </li>
                <li>Sensation of fullness in the face </li>
                <li>Thick yellowish or greenish nasal discharge - there may be mucus dripping to the back of the throat, often causing a cough that is worse on lying down. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some people may also experience aching pain in the jaw, teeth or ears or a reduced sense of smell and taste. Other general symptoms include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bad breath </li>
                <li>Fever </li>
                <li>Nausea </li>
                <li>Fatigue </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In situations where there is significant inflammation of the mucosa membrane, the drainage pathway may be blocked, leading to trapping of mucus within the sinuses. This leads to the symptoms of blocked nose, nasal congestion, facial pain as well as foulsmelling discharge. The cause may be viral, bacterial or fungal in nature. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>A nasoendoscopic examination, may be performed to access the drainage pathways of the sinuses. The nasoendoscope is a small tubular flexible scope that is introduced into the nose to visualise the nasal passages. It is not a painful procedure but some patients may experience a little discomfort. An examination of the nasal passages will also reveal the presence of any purulent nasal discharge. <br>
            <br>
            In cases of persistent sinusitis, a specimen of the discharge may be taken for culture to identify the bacteria and help in the selection of antibiotics. <br>
            <br>
            A computed tomographic scan (CT scan) may also be done to show any anatomical abnormalities that may lead to recurrent or prolonged episodes of sinusitis. </p>
