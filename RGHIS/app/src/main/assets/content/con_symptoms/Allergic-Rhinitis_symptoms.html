                <li>Blocked nose </li>
                <li>Runny nose </li>
                <li>Post-nasal drip as well as watery and itchy eyes </li>
            </ul>
            <p>These occur after exposure to the allergen. For example, walking into a dusty room may cause such symptoms to develop. </p>

            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>There is often a history of other allergies and sensitive skin and some people may also have asthma. A <strong>skin prick test</strong> may be able to identify the offending allergen (substance that triggers the allergic response). It is a simple test performed in the clinic. <br>
            <br>
            In a skin prick test, a small area of skin, usually on the forearm is used to test for allergies to various allergens. A small amount of allergen is then applied to the skin and the area observed for a positive reaction. <br>
            <br>
            By identifying the allergen, severe or recurrent attacks can be reduced by avoiding or minimising subsequent exposure to the allergen. Common allergens include dust mites and pollen. </p>
