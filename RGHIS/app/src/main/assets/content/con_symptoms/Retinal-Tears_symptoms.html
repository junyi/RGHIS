<h2>How do I know if I have Retinal Tears?</h2>
<p>Retinal tears are painless. Some symptoms include seeing an increased number of , and decreased vision.</p>
<p>Floaters are small, moving spots in the field of view and can even be seen when the eyes are closed. A sudden increase in number or size of floaters may suggest a retinal tear. Flashes, the seeing of a bright light in your field of vision, is also a possible sign of a retinal tear. This happens when the vitreous pulls on the retina and causes a bright visual response.  </p>
<p>Retinal tears can progress to a more serious stage when retinal detachments occur, so early detection of retinal tears are essential to prevent the problem from worsening.</p>
