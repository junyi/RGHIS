<h2>How Can I Tell If My Baby Is Jaundiced?</h2>
<p>The best way to detect jaundice is to place the baby in good light such as daylight or fluorescent lights. The skin of the baby with jaundice usually appears yellow, first in the face, thereafter moving downwards to the chest, abdomen, arms and legs as the bilirubin level increases.</p>
<p>The whites of the eye may also appear yellow. In tanned skin babies, jaundice may be hard to detect visually. </p>
<h2>How Should My Baby Be Checked For Jaundice?</h2>
<p>If your baby appears jaundiced in the first few days of life, the doctor may conduct a blood test to determine your baby's bilirubin level. A bilirubin level is always needed if jaundice develops before a baby is 24 hours old.</p>
<p>Further tests might be needed, depending on the age of the baby, the bilirubin level as well as other factors that predispose the baby to jaundice.</p>
<h2>When Should My Baby Get Checked For Jaundice After Leaving The Hospital?</h2>
<p>It is important for your baby to be seen by a nurse or doctor when your baby is between 3 to 5 days old, because this is usually the time when a baby's bilirubin level is the highest.</p>
<p>The timing of this visit may vary depending on the age of your baby when discharged from the hospital, advice given upon discharge and other factors.</p>
<h2>Does Breastfeeding Affect Jaundice?</h2>
<p>Jaundice is more common in babies who are breastfed than those on formula milk. But this occurs mainly in infants who have not been nursing well.</p>
<p>If you are breastfeeding, you should nurse your baby at least 8 to 12 times a day for the first few days. This will help you produce enough milk and help keep baby's bilirubin level down.</p>
<p>If you are having difficulty breastfeeding, consult your doctor, nurse or lactation specialist for help. Breast milk is the IDEAL food for your baby.</p>
<h2>Which Babies Require More Attention For Jaundice?</h2>
<p>Some babies have a greater risk for high levels of bilirubin. Risk factors include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Prematurity </li>
    <li>Appearance of jaundice in the first 24 hours after birth </li>
    <li>Breastfeeding that is not going well </li>
    <li>Bruising or bleeding under the scalp, which are related to labour and delivery </li>
    <li>Family history of jaundice: A parent of sibling who had high bilirubin level and required light therapy </li>
    <li class=last>G6PD deficiency </li>
</ul>
