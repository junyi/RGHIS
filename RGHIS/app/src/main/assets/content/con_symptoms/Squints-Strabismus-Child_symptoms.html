<h2>Early signs to look out for if your child has Squints</h2>
<p>Parents will often notice that their childs eyes may be poorly co-ordinated and not aligned. In some forms of strabismus, the children may close one eye to obscure the double image sometimes associated with strabismus, or tilt his/head to achieve better alignment.</p>
<p>Many Chinese babies often appear to have a convergent squint as a result of a prominent (Mongoloid) skin fold that covers the inner part of the eye, causing the eyes to appear closer together. This is a pseudo-squint, and no treatment is necessary. Your local doctor will often be able to tell you whether your child has a true strabismus or not, and will refer your child onto an eye specialist is he/she is uncertain or suspects a problem.</p>
