            Skin biopsy is used to diagnose skin cancer. It is a simple procedure done under local aneasthesia. Either part of the suspected growth or the whole growth if it is small is removed and sent to the pathologist. The pathologist will examine the specimen under the microscope and confirm the diagnosis. The pathologist will also determine the histologic type (cell type of the cancer cells), the thickness of the cancer (depth of invasion) and other characteristics of the skin cancer.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">Other tests such as lymph node biopsy, blood test and imaging may be required for staging, treatment and prognosis.</p>
