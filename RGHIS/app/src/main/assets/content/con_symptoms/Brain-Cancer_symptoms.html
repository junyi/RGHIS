            <p><strong>Symptoms and Signs of Brain Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            Adults with brain cancers are usually diagnosed after they developed fits or seizures. Other signs and symptoms that suggest increased pressure within the skull include persistent headaches associated with vomiting and double vision. Pressure builds up within the skull because the skull is a bony structure that cannot expand. A cancer growing within the brain inside the skull causes pressure to increase. Other patients may develop weakness of one side of their body similar to a stroke.</p>

            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Diagnostic Tests</strong><br>
            <br>
            Computerised scans (CT) and magnetic resonance scans (MRI) of the brain are able to diagnose most brain cancers. These scans may also determine if there is increased pressure within the skull. The exact type of cancer will be determined after a biopsy of the cancer. Sometimes, because of the position of the cancer, biopsy is not attempted because the risk of causing damage to neighbouring important structures is very high. </p>
