<h2>What are the symptoms of RVO?<br>
 </h2>
The obstruction to the blood flow in the optic nerve by a RVO can cause blurring of vision or visual loss. These symptoms range from mild to severe and can either occur suddenly or gradually over time. In some cases there might be pain and blindness in the affected eye. Because of the threat to vision, regular eye examinations are important to pick up the problem early. An eye examination for RVO usually includes a range of vision tests to check vision accuracy and some investigations to study the eye itself and the presence of swelling or blockages.<br>
