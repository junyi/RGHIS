            Symptoms </span></h2>
            <p>Thyroid nodules usually do not cause symptoms, but some symptoms include :</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pain</strong>  if there is bleeding into the nodule or inflammation. </li>
                <li><strong>Difficulty swallowing or breathing</strong>  if the thyroid gland or nodule is large. </li>
                <li><strong>Hyperthyroidism symptoms</strong> like heat intolerance, fast heart rate, weight loss and tremors  if the nodule produces excessive thyroid hormone. </li>
                <li><strong>Hypothyroidism symptoms</strong> including cold intolerance, lethargy, weight gain and weakness  if less thyroid hormone is produced. </li>
                <li><strong>Hoarseness</strong>  if there is a cancer invading the nerve supplying your vocal cords. This symptom warrants immediate attention. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Prevention</span></h2>
            <p>In Singapore where iodine deficiency is not a problem, there are no preventable causes of thyroid nodules or goitre. Radiation is a risk factor for thyroid cancer, but this is a rare occupational or treatment risk for a small group of individuals.</p>

            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)</strong><br>
            <br>
            A minor procedure performed in the clinic, a fine needle is inserted into the nodule and cells are withdrawn for evaluation. You will be able to return home or to work immediately. The test aims to determine if your thyroid nodule is cancerous, but the result is occasionally inconclusive.</p>
            <p><strong>Ultrasound</strong><br>
            <br>
            Sound waves are used to form a picture of the thyroid gland. It allows your doctor to determine if your thyroid nodule is solid, cystic (fluidfilled) or mixed, the number of nodules and also to take measurements to track the growth of the nodules. </p>
            <p>Most importantly, it allows the doctor to identify features that may be suggestive of cancer, including microcalcifications, internal vascularity and hazy boundaries, possibly from invasion of surrounding tissue. It may also be used to help locate nodules and to guide the needle in FNAC for more representative results.</p>
            <p><strong>Thyroid scan</strong><br>
            <br>
            You take a small amount of radioactive iodine orally. It is taken up by functioning thyroid cells, which will show up on a scan.</p>
            <p>Functioning nodules are less likely to be cancerous. Cold nodules or nonfunctioning nodules require further evaluation with FNAC.</p>
            <p><strong>Thyroid function test</strong><br>
            <br>
            A blood test to determine the level of thyroid hormone and thyroid stimulating hormone. It may be useful if you have hyper or hypothyroid symptoms or if you require surgery.</p>
