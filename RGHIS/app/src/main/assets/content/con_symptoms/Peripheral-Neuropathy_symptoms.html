            <p>The clinical presentation will depend on the type of nerve fibers affected. </p>
            <p>Motor nerve damage causes weakness, painful cramps and muscle twitching.</p>
            <p>Sensory nerve damage causes a decrease in the appreciation of pinprick, light touch or vibration sensations on the hands and feet. It may also cause unsteadiness when walking. Pain receptors can become oversensitised resulting in spontaneous burning pain, discomfort to light touch (allodynia) and hypersensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia).</p>
            <p>Involvement of autonomic nerves results in a variety of symptoms, e.g. abnormal sweating, postural giddiness, irregular heart rate, urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction in men.</p>
