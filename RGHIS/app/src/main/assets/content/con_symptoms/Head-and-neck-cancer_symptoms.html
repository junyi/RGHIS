            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Risk Factors</span></h2>
            <p>Risk factors for head and neck cancer include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Smoking </li>
                <li>Drinking alcohol </li>
                <li>Tobacco or betel nut chewing </li>
                <li>Excessive sun exposure for skin cancer </li>
                <li>Family history of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) </li>
            </ul>
            The total increase in risk with smoking and alcohol together is higher than the sum of their individual risks. </div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Symptoms>
            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
            Prevention</span></h2>
            <p>Head and neck cancer and its treatment can lead to significant problems functionally and cosmetically even if cured. Prevention is certainly better than cure in this situation and the greatest risk reduction can be achieved by not smoking and not consuming alcohol. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>When you have any of the above symptoms, your primary care doctor will refer you to an  or Head &amp; Neck Surgeon. Your surgeon will first perform a complete head and neck examination, which will usually include examination of the mouth, flexible fibreoptic endoscopy of the nose, pharynx and larynx and examination of the neck.</p>
            <p>Depending on the suspected location and type of tumour, the following investigations may be ordered.</p>
            <p><strong>To determine the type of cancer</strong> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Biopsy  removing a small piece of tumour for testing if it can be easily reached </li>
                <li>Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)  using a needle to extract cells for testing, from lymph node or if tumour is deep </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>To evaluate extent or stage of cancer</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>CT or MRI scan of the head and neck region </li>
                <li>CT of lungs and liver </li>
                <li>Bone scan </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Miscellaneous tests</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>EBV serology  blood test for risk of nasopharyngeal cancer </li>
            </ul>
            <p>A diagnostic operation, panendoscopy, may be necessary on top of the above investigations, to accurately determine the extent of the tumour and examine the rest of the areas at risk for a second cancer, which may exist in up to 10% of patients. This operation involves examining the entire pharynx and larynx (throat), trachea (windpipe) and oesophagus (food passage) with the aid of rigid scopes under general anaesthesia. </p>
