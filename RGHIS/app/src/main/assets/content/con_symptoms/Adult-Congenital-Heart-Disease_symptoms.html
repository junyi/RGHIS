            <p>Despite their improved life expectancy, congenital patients stepping into adulthood face many issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They have limited understanding of their underlying congenital defects </li>
                <li>Many believe that they are 'cured, unaware of possible sequel from their surgery and the need for further surgical procedures </li>
                <li>Medical and surgical issues which require life-long follow up, regular check up and repeated investigations and evaluation </li>
                <li>Issues related to pregnancy, contraception, risk to offspring need to be discussed </li>
                <li>Risk of endocarditis and the need for antibiotic prophylaxis </li>
                <li>Management of associated non-cardiac medical problems </li>
                <li>Social, emotional, financial, vocational, educational, psychological and lifestyle issues specific to each individual. As they enter adulthood, ACHD patients need to take charge of their lives, substituting parental overprotection in childhood with a sense of responsibility and maturity of their own </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the past, these adult patients were usually managed by paediatric cardiologists who, although excellent in interpreting and comprehending the underlying physiology and haemodynamics, were nonetheless ill-equipped in managing adult related problems like coronary artery disease, pregnancy and contraception, arrhythmias, hypertension. Research has shown that ACHD patients especially those of moderate to severe complexity do better when their care is centralised to a dedicated specialised ACHD unit.</p>
