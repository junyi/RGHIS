            The most obvious symptoms are shoulder pain and a limited range of motion in the shoulder. <br>
            <br>
            You may also have difficulties moving the shoulder normally and engaging in daily activities such as reaching across the table, putting on a shirt and overhead motions like combing the hair. Motion is also limited on both passive and active motion. <br>
            <br>
            Often, in the early stages, pain is a predominant symptom, and can affect sleep.<br>
            <br>
            There are 3 stages of a frozen shoulder, namely:
            <ul>
                <li>Freezing stage (Stage 1): This is the painful stage and motion of the shoulder is limited. This stage normally lasts 6-12 weeks. </li>
                <li>Frozen stage (Stage 2): The pain eases in this stage but the stiffness remains. This stage generally lasts 4 to 6 months. </li>
                <li>Thawing stage (Stage 3): In the final stage, the motion in the arm gradually improves over a long period. This stage can last more than 1 year. </li>
            </ul>

            </span></h2>
            <br>
            A frozen shoulder can be diagnosed on the basis of medical history and clinical examination. An x-ray or MRI can be used to rule out other causes such as arthritis and rotator cuff tears. </div>
