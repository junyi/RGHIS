            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Symptoms </span></h2>
            <p>A person may be diagnosed as having an episode of major <strong>depression</strong> if he experiences five or more of the following symptoms for two weeks or longer.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Depressed mood or sadness most of the time </li>
                <li>Lack of energy, feeling tired all the time </li>
                <li>Inability to enjoy things that used to bring pleasure </li>
                <li>Withdrawal from friends and family </li>
                <li>Irritability, anger or anxiety </li>
                <li>Inability to concentrate </li>
                <li>Significant weight loss or gain </li>
                <li>Significant change in sleep patterns </li>
                <li>Feelings of guilt or worthlessness </li>
                <li>Physical symptoms, e.g. aches and pains even though nothing is physically wrong </li>
                <li>Pessimism and indifference </li>
                <li>Thoughts of death or suicide </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Persons with depression may, in some cases, entertain delusions (false unshakeable beliefs) usually involving any of the three themes, namely, guilt, ill health or poverty. These beliefs cannot be reasoned away and are not shared by others in the family or social circle.</p>
            <p>Persons who are depressed sometimes report hearing voices scolding them, telling them they are useless and that they should go and die. Worse still, the voices may also tell them to commit suicide. </p>
