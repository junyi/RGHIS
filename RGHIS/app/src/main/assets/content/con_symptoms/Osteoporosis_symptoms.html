            <p>Osteoporosis is called the 'silent disease because bone loss occurs without symptoms and is painless. The condition often is not detected until it is quite advanced. Some signs in the advanced stages may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fracture of the hip, spine and wrists </li>
                <li>Back pain </li>
                <li>Loss of height over time </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Osteoporosis can be detected through a Bone Density Test most commonly done using a DEXA scan. The test can determine if you have osteoporosis by measuring the bone mineral density or bone strength at the hip and spine. <br>
            <br>
            The test is quick and painless and is similar to having an x-ray taken but uses much less radiation.<br>
            <br>
