            <p>The clinical features of food poisoning are profuse vomiting, diarrhoea, crampy abdominal pain within 8 to 24 hours after ingestion of the contaminated foods. Fever may or may not be present. Diarrhoea can range from very mild, self limiting disease of one to a few loose stools and only minimal symptoms. At the other end of the spectrum, 'dysentery' like syndrome can be seen with soft, watery stools that may contain blood, mucus and pus. </p>
