            <p><strong>Symptoms and Signs of Nasopharyngeal Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            A painless lump in the neck is found in nearly 75% of newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal cancer. A doctor should be seen if any of the following symptoms develop and persist: a painless lump in the neck, excessive nose discharge or blockage or bleeding, decreased hearing or ringing in the ears, or unusual face pain or numbness, double vision or headache. As cancer can spread to any organ or tissue in the body, in the late stages there may be symptoms from the lung, bone or liver.</p>

            <p><strong>Diagnostic Tests</strong><br>
            <br>
            If nasopharyngeal cancer is suspected, a doctor will look for swelling or lumps in the neck. The doctor may examine the nasopharynx with a special angled mirror that is placed at the back of the throat or pass a flexible tube called a nasoscope (usually 5 - 6 mm in diasmeter) into one of the nostrils and to the back of the nose to look for lumps or ulcers. Small pieces of tissues may be removed during this examination to diagnose cancer. This is called biopsy.</p>
            <p>If there is a neck lump, small pieces of the lump can be removed using a needle and syringe under local anaesthesia. The tissue is then examined under a mircoscope to look for cancer cells.</p>
            <p>Once cancer is confirmed, further tests will be done to see if the cancer has spread from the nasopharynx to other parts of the body. The tests usually include a thorough physical examination, blood tests, chest x-rays and scans of the head and neck region. A bone scan and liver scan may also be ordered to see if the cancer is suspected to have spread to these areas. </p>
