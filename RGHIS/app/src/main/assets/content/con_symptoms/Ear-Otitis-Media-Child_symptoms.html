<h2>What Are The Signs And Symptoms Of OME?</h2>
<p>Older children often complain of earache and hearing loss. Younger ones may become fussy, sleep poorly, and often pull and tug at the ear. However, in the majority of the time, the children are unaware of the hearing loss. The caregiver may notice that the child turns up the volume of the radio / TV or is not attentive during normal conversation. Teachers may also complain that the child is doing poorly in school or is inattentive during lessons.</p>

<h2>How Is OME Diagnosed?</h2>
<center></center>
<p>There are several ways of diagnosing OME. Very often, on clinical examination, the ear drums are found to be dull and sometimes bubbles of air may be seen behind them. Audiogram typically shows that of a mild conductive hearing loss of about 30 dB. Tympanogram may also show a type 'B' tracing as opposed to a normal type 'A'.</p>
