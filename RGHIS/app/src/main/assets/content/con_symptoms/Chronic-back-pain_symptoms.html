            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>As chronic back pain may be caused by many factors, your doctor will conduct a thorough medical history and physical examination. Imaging tests may be ordered to rule out conditions such as infection, cancer or fractures. Some of the tests ordered are: <br>
            <br>
            <strong>X-rays. </strong>To check for fractures or other problems in the bone. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>MRI.</strong> MRIâ€™s can be used to detect conditions including slipped discs, nerve root compression, infections of the bone or spinal canal, fractures or tumours. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>CT Scan.</strong> Similar function as x-ray but shows greater details. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Nerve Conduction Study / Electromyogram.</strong> Also know as NCS and EMG, this is a nerve test that can help to determine the presence of nerve abnormality. The test will help to distinguish between nerve root and muscle disease.</p>
