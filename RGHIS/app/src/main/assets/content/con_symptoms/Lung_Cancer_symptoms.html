            <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Symptoms and Signs of Lung Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            Cigarette smoking causes lung damage even in the absence of cancer. The symptoms associated with lung damage are cough and shortness of breath.There may be occasions when there is production of blood stained sputum even when there is no cancer. Lung infections are also common in persons with lung damage. Dilation of the air spaces, or emphysema, is reported to be an especially common complication of smoking in Chinese persons. Lung cancer usually develops in the presence of lung damage. The symptoms and signs of lung cancer may be indistinguishable from lung damage caused by cigarette smoking. Occasionally, lung cancer is diagnosed incidentally when a pre-employment or routine chest x-ray is performed.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Diagnostic Tests</strong><br>
            <br>
            Any persistent cough or change in the nature of the cough, the appearance of blood-stained sputum, or unexplained breathlessness should prompt a person to seek medical advice. Often chest x-rays are important in the first diagnosis of lung cancer. Sputum may be sent for testing for cancer cells or infections, such as tuberculosis, which is not uncommon in Singapore.<br>

            If the suspicion of cancer is high, a bronchoscopy may be arranged. In this examination, a fiber optic tube about 7mm in diameter is introduced through the nose and into the lung under light-sedation and local anaesthesia. You will be able to breathe normally during the procedure which lasts 15 to 30 minutes. Small pieces of tissue can be painlessly removed for further examination to diagnose cancer. Some management decisions in lung cancer (especially pertaining to targeted therapies), require specific genetic tests to be done on cancer cells from your biopsy sample.<br>

            Once cancer is diagnosed, computerised tomography (CT) scans of the chest and liver may be performed to determine if the cancer has spread to other organs, such as the liver or adrenal gland, which is just above the kidneys on both sides. Occasionally, bone scans and CT scans of the brain are also required.<br>

            A lung function test, which involves blowing into a large cylinder, may be performed pre-operatively to determine the lung function prior to any surgery discussions.</p>
