            Symptoms</span></h2>
            <p>The signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism vary widely, depending on the severity of the hormone deficiency, but these tend to develop slowly, often over a number of years. You may barely notice symptoms such as fatigue and sluggishness, which may seem to be just part and parcel of getting older at first. As your metabolism continues to slow, the signs and symptoms become more obvious.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Complications </span></h2>
            <p>Left untreated, hypothyroidism may cause complications such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increased risk of developing heart disease.</strong> A low thyroxine level causes blood lipids such as LDL, or &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol, to rise. </li>
                <li><strong>Increased risk of developing pregnancy complications.</strong> Examples include pre-eclampsia, anaemia, premature labour, low birth weight, stillbirth, birth defects, and serious bleeding<br>
                after childbirth. </li>
                <li><strong>Myxedema coma.</strong> A very rare complication that may be fatal. </li>
            </ul>
            </div>
