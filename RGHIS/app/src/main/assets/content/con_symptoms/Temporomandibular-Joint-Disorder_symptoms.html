<ul>
    <li>Noises - You may hear clicking or grating noises on opening or closing your mouth. If this is not accompanied by pain and limitation in mouth opening, no treatment is required </li>
    <li>Pain - Dull pain, on opening and closing of the mouth, can be experienced over the jaw joint area (just in front of the ear) or at the cheek or at the temple region. A clicking or grating sound may accompany the pain. The pain is usually due to inflammation of the joint and/or the muscles and may cause difficulty in chewing and biting food. </li>
    <li>Restriction in mouth opening and closing - Trauma, excessive pressure or degenerative changes to the joint, can cause displacement of the cartilage disk in the joint. This causes obstruction to the normal movement of the joint leading to difficulty in opening and closing your mouth. </li>
</ul>
You may experience difficulty in eating and a sudden inability to close your mouth, which may or may not be spontaneously resolved. <br>
