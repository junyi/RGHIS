            <ul>
                <li>Your bed partner notices that you have loud, frequent snoring </li>
                <li>Your bed partner notices that you periodically stop breathing during your sleep and gasp for breath </li>
                <li>You wake up feeling tired. Some patients have a morning headache and dry mouth as well </li>
                <li>You are sleepy and tired through the day </li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, not everyone who snores has sleep apnoea and conversely, not everyone with sleep apnoea snores. </p>
            <p><strong>I don't awake repeatedly throughout the night. Does it mean I do not have sleep apnoea? </strong></p>
            <p>No. Most people with sleep apnoea do not realize that they are awakening to breathe repeatedly throughout the night. This is because the arousal is slight and most people become accustomed to this. However even this slight arousal is enough to disrupt the pattern of sleep and lead to unrefreshing sleep. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>What should I do if I think I may have sleep apnoea? </strong></p>
            <p>The best thing is see your doctor. He may refer you to a specialist or sleep disorders unit for you to undergo evaluation which may include spending the night in a sleep lab to undergo a sleep study call 'polysomnogram'. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><a name=Diagnosis><span class=articletitle style="color:#ff6600"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></span></a></span></h2>
            <p><strong>A sleep study or polysomnogram</strong> is a diagnostic test for sleep apnoea that involves sleeping overnight in a sleep laboratory. The patient is connected to a machine that records a variety of body functions during sleep including the electrical activity of the brain, eye movement, muscle activity, heart rate, respiratory effort, air flow and blood oxygen levels. In addition to diagnosing sleep apnoea, the severity of the sleep apnoea can also be determined. </p>
