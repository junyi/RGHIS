            Symptoms </span></h2>
            <p>When your child breathes in air that contains TB germs, he/she may get a 'silent' TB infection (also known as <strong>Latent TB Infection</strong> or <strong>LTBI</strong>). This means that the immune defence of your childs body have kept the offending germs under control, and he/she has dormant (or sleeping) TB bacteria. LTBI does not make your child sick and <span style="text-decoration:underline">cannot be passed to anyone else</span>. Patients with LTBI do not have any symptoms. </p>
            <p>However, if the childs body does not keep the TB germs under control, particularly (though not always) if he/she has other health problems, for example HIV infection and diabetes, etc, then these dormant TB germs could 'wake up' and multiply. The child will become sick with active TB (or <strong>TB Disease</strong>). This usually happens in the first two years after infection. </p>
            <p>TB usually affects the lungs. Patients with TB Disease may complain of persistent cough (the sputum may be blood-stained or he/she may actually coughs up blood), fever, night sweats, weight loss, loss of appetite, and getting tired easily. However, it can also affect other parts of the body, such as lymph nodes, bones, joints, kidneys, intestines, skin, brain, liver, and the coverings of the heart. As such, the symptoms of TB Disease can be very variable depending on the organ affected. Patients with TB Disease <strong>can pass the germs to other people</strong>.</p>

            Risk Factors</span></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Children with health problems such as HIV infection or diabetes. </li>
                <li>Younger children (especially those 5 years and below) also have an increased risk of getting active TB when they are infected, as their bodies are usually less capable of keeping the TB bacteria under control </li>

            <h2>Prevention</h2>
            </div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Symptoms>
            <h2></h2>
            <p>Severe forms of TB in infancy (such as TB in the brain or widespread TB in the body) may be prevented by BCG vaccine, but it is not 100% effective and cannot prevent other forms of TB (such as that in the lungs) and cannot prevent TB later in life. On a personal level, if you have TB, you should seek and adhere to active treatment, and practice self-quarantine for the short duration advised by your doctor. On a community level, we should actively identify and help TB sufferers get access to appropriate treatment and adhere to quarantine measures.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>The presence of symptoms may suggest TB, but they cannot be used to confirm TB. Furthermore, patients with Latent TB Infection do not have any symptoms. Your doctor will need to obtain the relevant history and perform a detailed physical examination. Depending on the clinical information, your doctor may perform certain tests such as a TB skin test, blood tests, chest X-ray, and sputum or early-morning gastric (stomach) fluid tests. Other tests may be ordered depending on the individuals symptoms, and consultation will be made with our attending Infectious Disease Consultants. Some of these tests, especially those that attempt to culture or <span style="text-decoration:underline">grow</span> TB germs, may take up to 2 months to be ready. Therefore in some cases, your doctor may advise presumptive treatment based on a combination of suggestive symptoms, signs and/or test results.</p>
            <p>Children who are suspected of having TB Disease may be required to be hospitalised initially for the necessary tests and treatment to be performed.</p>
