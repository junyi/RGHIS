<h2>How do I know if I have Central Serous Chorioretinopathy?</h2>
<p>You may notice blurred or distorted central vision. An eye exam by an eye doctor can accurately diagnose the problem. Usually this is done through a clinical examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan. Fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography may be recommended by your eye doctor to assess the severity and level of activity of your condition to aide in formulating a treatment plan.</p></div>
