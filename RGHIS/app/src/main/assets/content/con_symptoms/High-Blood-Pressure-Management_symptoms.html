            <p>Hypertension usually causes no symptoms, but often leads to the damage of various body organs in the long-term. It is for this reason that high blood pressure or hypertension is referred to as 'the silent killer'. Over time, it can lead to damage of the heart and blood vessels, leading to stroke, heart attack or renal failure. Occasionally, when the blood pressure is extremely high, headaches, dizziness or alterations in vision can be experienced.</p>
            </span></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Older people are at a higher risk of developing hypertension. Most of the patients are found to have no cause for the high blood pressure and are categorised as essential hypertension. About 10% of high blood pressure patients have it as a result of kidney diseases or hormonal disorders (secondary hypertension). </p>

            <p>A blood pressure reading of 120/80mmHg is read as '120 over 80 millimetres of mercury'. The top number is your systolic pressure, which is the pressure in your arteries when the heart pumps. The bottom number is the diastolic blood pressure, which is the blood pressure in your arteries when your heart relaxes between contractions.</p>
            <p>Normal blood pressure may vary from 90/60mmHg to 120/80mmHg in a young healthy woman. Hypertension is present when a persons blood pressure is persistently above 140/90mmHg. If you have diabetes or kidney disease, you must strive to maintain your blood pressure at around 120/80mmHg as even marginally higher blood pressure will increase your risk of developing complications.</p>
            <p>In most cases, a doctor will use a familiar device called a sphygmomanometer. Some blood pressure testing devices use electronic instruments with digital readouts. In these cases, the blood pressure reading appears on a small screen.</p>
            <p>Blood pressure measurements can also be carried out at the convenience of your home. Before you use the equipment, you should first understand the given instructions thoroughly on how to use the device and take readings. You may wish to calibrate your reading with your family doctor. Blood pressure devices are readily available at various healthcare outlets and pharmacies.</p>

            <p>You should check your blood pressure at least once a year. Marginally elevated blood pressure may normalise when you lose weight, exercise more and reduce salt intake. </p>
            <p>1. Eat a healthy diet  Avoid foods high in cholesterol and saturated fats such as animal fats, whole milk products, eggs, red meat such as beef and lamb, coconut milk and palm oil. Instead, choose lean meat, fish and low-fat dairy products and increase your intake of fruits and vegetables. Cut back on salty foods as well. </p>
            <p>2. Exercise regularly  It is important to exercise at least three times a week. Although there are many kinds of physical activities you could do, walking is one of the best forms of exercise to do. To find out which types of physical activities are suitable for you, check with your doctor.</p>
            <p>3. Watch your weight  It has been proven that maintaining a healthy body weight reduces the risks of high blood pressure. To give you a good idea of whether you are keeping a healthy weight, refer to above table.</p>
            <p>4. Quit smoking  Smoking can elevate the blood pressure and is also an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease and stroke. </p>
            <p>5. Take it easy  To manage stress, engage in regular exercises. Adopt a balanced approach to work and family life. In addition, relax whenever possible to ease the tension whenever feelings of stress arise since stress may aggravate your blood pressure.</p>
            <p>If these measures are not successful, then drug treatment maybe needed. However, once medicine has been started, it is essential to continue with the treatment, complemented by a healthy lifestyle. Treatment of hypertension for most people is life-long.</p>
