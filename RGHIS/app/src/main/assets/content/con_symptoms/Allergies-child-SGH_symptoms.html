            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Symptoms </span></h2>
            <p>Most allergic reactions are easily controlled. But some can lead to an anaphylactic reaction, which is a serious allergic reaction that progresses rapidly and can be fatal. Symptoms may include a combination of rashes, shortness of breath, <strong>chest pain</strong> or tightness, weak pulse, dizziness, swelling of the eyes, lips or tongue, difficulty swallowing, abdominal cramps or vomiting. An anaphylactic reaction is an emergency, which needs immediate medical attention.</p>
            <p>Listed below are some common allergies, their symptoms and triggers. Consult your doctor if your child displays any of these symptoms.</p>
            <p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Asthma<br>
            </em></span></strong>Children with asthma often have cough, tight chest or difficulty breathing. These signs are worse in the morning or at night and could also be due to exercise or physical activity. </p>
            <p>Common triggers include viral infections, cigarette smoke, house dust mites, animal fur, weather changes and even stress.</p>
            <p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Allergic Rhinitis<br>
            </span></em></strong>Allergic rhinitis is usually due to inhaling house dust mites, mould and animal dander. The condition can be frustrating to a child as he or she will sneeze often and have an itchy and runny nose, which can get stuffy. The child may start to breathe through the mouth. Often the child also has watery and itchy eyes, which may become red and swollen.</p>
            <p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Eczema<br>
            </span></em></strong>In infants, eczema tends to occur on the cheeks, behind the ears and on the thighs. As the child grows, these dry, itchy and red patches are often found in the folds of the neck, arms and legs. Eczema can be worsened by food allergies or contact with allergens such as house dust mites and animal fur.</p>
            <p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Food allergies<br>
            </span></em></strong>These can be mild or serious enough to cause an anaphylactic reaction. Common triggers include peanuts, eggs, wheat, soy and shellfish.</p>
            <p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Hives<br>
            </span></em></strong>Hives are commonly caused by food allergies, medicines and viral infections. These raised, red and itchy skin patches look like mosquito bites and can be found on different parts of the body. They usually appear in crops and do not stay at the same spot for more than a few hours.</p>
            <p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">Contact dermatitis<br>
            </span></em></strong>Unlike hives, the red itchy patches are confined to areas which have come into direct contact with the allergen, which may include chemicals found in perfumes, cosmetics, detergents or plant substances such as poison ivy. If severe, the rashes may even blister.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Risk Factors</span></h2>
            <p>Children have a higher risk of developing allergies than adults, although some children outgrow their allergies as they get older. A family history of allergies and having asthma also increase the childs risk of allergies.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Primary risk factors: <br>
            </strong>Allergies are hereditary and passed from parents to children. So a child with at least one parent with allergies is likely to develop allergies. A child with asthma is also more likely to develop other allergies.</p>
            <p><strong>Secondary risk factors:</strong><br>
            Exposure to allergens when the bodys immune system is weak, such as after a viral infection, also seems to increase the risk of allergies. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Prevention</span></h2>
            <p>Prevention of allergies depends on the type of allergy you have. Once you know what triggers your allergic reaction, you should do your best to avoid those triggers. Common triggers include viral infections, cigarette smoke, house dust mites, animal fur, weather changes and even stress.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">When To Seek Help</span></h2>
            <p>Seek medication attention if your symptoms get worse over a few days, or if they do not improve with treatment. You should see a doctor at once if you suddenly develop severe or rapidly worsening symptoms such as:</p>
            <p>- swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat<br>
            - wheezing, chest tightness, loud breathing, or trouble breathing<br>
            - sweating, nausea, or vomiting<br>
            - widespread rash</p>
