<h2>How do I know if I have Glaucoma?</h2>
<p>The disease can develop slowly and you may not be aware of the gradual loss of sight until very late in the disease when your vision is seriously affected.<br>

<p><strong><span style="color:#000000">This is an interactive illustration demonstrating the loss of the field of vision at different stages of glaucoma severity. </span></strong></p>
</span>
<ul>
    <li><span style="color:#000000">Please use the mouse, click and hold down the blue arrow.</span> </li>
    <li>As you begin to slide the blue arrow towards the right, you will see a magnified view of a normal healthy optic nerve in the right box. </li>
    <li>As this optic nerve is normal and healthy, the field of vision shown on the left box is normal. </li>
    <li>However once a patient develops glaucoma, there is progressive optic nerve damage from the loss of healthy nerve fibres (see right box image), thus leading to progressive loss of the visual field. </li>
    <li>The patient will experience this as a progressive 'tunnelling' of vision or constriction of the field of vision (see left box image). </li>
    <li>This is illustrated by sliding the blue arrow between the points indicating &quot;Early Glaucoma&quot; and &quot;Advanced Glaucoma&quot;.   </li>
</ul>
