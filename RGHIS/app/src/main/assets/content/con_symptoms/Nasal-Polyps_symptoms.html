            Symptoms</span></h2>
            <p>The polyps result in fleshy lumps within the sinuses and nasal cavity that may completely obstruct the nasal passage, giving rise to the sensation of nasal obstruction. <br>
            <br>
            Other symptoms include : </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Decreased sense of smell </li>
                <li>Complete loss of smell </li>
                <li>Excess nasal secretions </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the polyps lead to obstruction of the sinuses, it may lead to sinusitis, which is an infection of the sinuses. </p>

            Prevention</span></h2>
            <p>To help reduce the chances of developing nasal polyps or recurrences, it is important to avoid any irritants and allergens as much as possible, and to manage any allergies or asthma, if present. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>A nasoendoscopic examination may be done to confirm the presence of polyps as well as to evaluate the extent of disease. Your doctor may also suggest allergy skin tests to find out if there are any allergies that may be contributing to the chronic inflammation. <br>
            <br>
            A Computed Tomographic (CT) scan of the sinuses may be done to determine the extent of the polyps in some cases, as well as to identify any other possible obstructions within the nasal cavity. The scan is also useful if surgery is needed. </p>
