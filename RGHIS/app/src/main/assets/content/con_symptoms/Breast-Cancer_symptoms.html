            <p><strong>Symptoms and Signs of Breast Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            About 80% of women with breast cancer first consult their doctor with a symptom they notice themselves. The most common feature is a breast lump. The lump may or may not be painful. Sometimes the nipple may be puckered (indrawn) or bleeding, or there is swelling of the skin of the breast. There may be a discharge from the nipple. Lymph glands of the armpit may also be enlarged. In advanced cases, breast cancer can spread to liver, lung, bone, or brain.</p>

            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Diagnostic Tests</strong><br>
            <br>
            A suspicious breast lump is usually subjected to an x-ray examination called a mammogram and a needle biopsy. Even if the mammogram is negative, a biopsy may be needed.</p>
            <p>A mammogram is an x-ray examination which helps to define the extent of the lump. It is sometimes combined with an ultrasound of the breast to determine if the lump is mainly solid or cystic, i.e. filled with liquid only. The mammogram examination is slightly uncomfortable as the breast is compressed against a metal surface to obtain a good x-ray image. Mammograms are much more useful for screening than for evaluation of symptomatic masses. Even if the mammogram is completely normal, a symptomatic breast mass may still need to be biopsied. </p>
            <p>A biopsy involves removal of tissue from the breast lump using a either core or skinny needle and syringe. This may be done in the clinic. The tissue is processed and sent to the pathologist, a doctor who will look at the tissue under a microscope. The pathologist will be able to tell if the tissue is cancerous.</p>
            <p>Mammotome Breast biopsy is a new technology that uses a vacuum-assisted device to obtain a biopsy from non-palpable lesions. This device can either be guided by ultrasound or by X-ray. Small samples of tissue are removed from the breast using a hollow needle which is guided precisely to the suspicious lesion via mammogram. This procedure is minimally invasive as compared to an open surgical biopsy, and it is performed as an outpatient procedure. It has the ability to sample tiny x-ray abnormalities, call microcalcifications, making early diagnosis of breast cancer possible. It is done under local anaesthesia and takes about 45 minutes to complete.</p>
            <p>Once cancer is diagnosed, other tests such as chest x-ray, ultrasound of the liver and bone scan may be required to determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.</p>
