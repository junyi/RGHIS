            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Symptoms </span></h2>
            <p>There are no symptoms of ROP. Infants, especially premature ones, must be screened by an ophthalmologist.</p></div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Symptoms>
            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Risk Factors</span></h2>
            <p>Premature babies who are born under 30 to 33 weeks of gestation are at higher risk of developing ROP than babies at over 34 weeks gestation. </p>
            <p>Premature infants more frequently need spectacles in early childhood than children who were not born premature. This may be the case even if your child did not have ROP, but it is more common in children with ROP. It is also possible to develop &quot;<strong>lazy eye</strong>&quot; (<strong>amblyopia</strong>) or wandering eye (strabismus). Severe ROP can lead to blindness. <br>

            Primary risk factors: <br>
            Premature babies born under 30 to 33 weeks of gestation have high risk of ROP. </p></div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Symptoms>
            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Prevention</span></h2>
            <p>The best way to prevent ROP is to avoid premature birth. Other measures include close monitoring of oxygen needs in premature babies. The baby should also have regular eye examinations by an ophthalmologist, especially if he or she has a high risk of ROP. </p></div>
