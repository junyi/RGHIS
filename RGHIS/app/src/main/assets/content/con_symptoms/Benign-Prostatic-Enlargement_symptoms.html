            Symptoms</span></h2>
            <p>If you have BPE, you may experience symptoms that include : </p>
            <ul>
                <li>a hesitant, interrupted, weak urine stream </li>
                <li>urgency and leaking or dribbling of urine </li>
                <li>more frequent urination, especially at night </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some men with greatly enlarged glands have little obstruction and few symptoms. Others, whose glands are less enlarged, may have more blockage and greater problems. Sometimes you may not know you have any obstruction until you suddenly find yourself unable to urinate at all. This condition, called acute urinary retention, may be triggered by taking certain cold medications that prevent the bladder opening from relaxing and allowing urine to empty. <br>
            <br>
            Severe BPE can, over time, cause serious problems such as urinary tract infections, bladder or kidney damage, bladder stones, and incontinence. If your bladder is permanently damaged, treatment for BPE may be ineffective. If BPE is found in its earlier stages, your risk of developing such complications is lower. </p>

            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>Some of the common tests to diagnose BPE include : </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital rectal examination (DRE).</strong> Your doctor inserts a gloved finger into the rectum and feels the prostate next to the rectum. This gives him a general idea of the size and condition of the gland. </li>
                <li><strong>Urine flow study.</strong> A special device you urinate into measures how quickly the urine is flowing. A reduced flow often suggests BPE. </li>
                <li><strong>Cystoscopy.</strong> A small tube, a cystoscope, is passed through the opening of the urethra in the penis. It contains a lens and light system that helps your doctor see the inside of the urethra, prostate and the bladder to identify the location and degree of the obstruction. </li>
            </ul>
            </div>
