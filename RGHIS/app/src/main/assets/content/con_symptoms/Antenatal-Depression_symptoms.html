            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
            Risk Factors</span></h2>
            <p>Women facing high stress, such as a number of the causative factors as listed in point 2 are particularly at risk. Also, women with a pre-existing depressive illness are also a risk of a relapse of depression during pregnancy, especially if their antidepressants are discontinued.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
            Prevention</span></h2>
            <p>Recognising and managing your personal levels of stress is particularly important at this time of transition into motherhood. For women with pre-existing depression, antenatal care planning, and early recognition of relapse symptoms is important. Support measures are particularly helpful, whether from your husband, family, friends or healthcare professionals.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>The diagnosis of Antenatal Depression is based on the criteria listed in point 3. Symptoms, with symptoms lasting two weeks or longer, interfering in your ability to function.</p>
            <p>If you are pregnant and depressed, you may hesitate to get help for depression because of the fear of what others might think and the concern about the medications prescribed. </p>
            <p>However, the management of antenatal depression involves looking at the stresses and causative factors, counselling, gathering support for you, and other forms of psychological therapy. Only when the depression is severe, will medication be recommended. Furthermore, there are certain medications that are compatible with pregnancy, and are safe for both the mother and growing fetus. </p>
            <p>If depression is left untreated, it will worsen and lead to adverse effects for you and your baby. With early recognition and treatment, chance of recovery can be good. The goal for early detection and treatment is to enable you to have the wonderful experience of caring for your baby.</p>

<h2>Antenatal Depression</h2>
<p>Whilst the previous emphasis and awareness have been on postpartum depression, research has suggested that antenatal depression, or depression during pregnancy, may be even more common than postnatal depression. Locally, about one in five pregnant women is likely to have depressive symptoms associated with impairment of functioning, and about one in ten will have clinical depression - that is, depression requiring medical attention. </p>
<p>We also now understand that antenatal depression often marks the onset of depressive illness in women and increases the risk of postnatal depression. As the common features of depression such as loss of appetite, poor sleep, feeling tired and forgetful are so similar to those of pregnancy, women can sometimes dismiss these symptoms. More useful symptoms to look out for would be pessimism and mood swings. </p>
<p>The symptoms of antenatal depression are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Low mood </li>
    <li>Irritability </li>
    <li>Loss in interest </li>
    <li>Poor sleep </li>
    <li>Poor appetite </li>
    <li>Excessive self-blame or guilt </li>
    <li>Feeling hopeless, or that life is meaningless </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Women can also look out for sign of their mood swings affecting their ability to relate to those around them, or their ability to cope with work, housework or other responsibilities. </p>

<h2>Causes for Antenatal Depression</h2>
<p>When a pregnant woman is tearful or emotional, the common reaction is 'Its her hormones!'. But whilst this may be partly true during the first trimester, when estrogen levels are low, and progesterone levels are relatively higher, and morning sickness adds to the misery, hormonal changes alone do not conclusively account for antenatal depression, otherwise every pregnant woman will be depressed! </p>
<p>The causes for antenatal depression are usually multifactorial, as with other types of depression and most psychiatric disorders. Often, it is an interplay of various factors, which leads to the onset of depression during pregnancy. As a pregnant woman, you will need to undergo a significant psychological adjustment as you adapt to the pregnancy and the notion that you will be nurturing a new life that you are fully responsible for. </p>
<p>If this is your first baby, the adjustment can be more challenging, especially :</p>
<ul>
    <li>if the pregnancy was unwanted or unplanned </li>
    <li>if you have had a difficult relationship with your own mother. The unresolved emotional conflicts will be awakened as you prepare to be a mother </li>
    <li>if you are working. You may not be able to convince yourself to let go of your career or you may have colleagues who are not understanding and supportive </li>
    <li>if you are a teenage or very young mother. The psychological adjustment needed to become a mother may be particularly difficult, as you are still very much in need of mothering </li>
</ul>
<p>Other factors that may contribute to antenatal depression include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Having a complicated pregnancy </li>
    <li>Fetal abnormalities </li>
    <li>If you have previous episodes of depression </li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the same factors that contribute to depression at any other time in a womans life will similarly affect her during her pregnancy: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Marital difficulties </li>
    <li>Interpersonal problems </li>
    <li>Financial and occupational problems </li>
    <li>Lack of social support </li>
    <li>Loss of a loved one </li>
    <li>Substance abuse and dependency </li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, if this is a precious pregnancy, or you have had difficulty conceiving or previous miscarriage, there is also an increased risk of depression. </p>
