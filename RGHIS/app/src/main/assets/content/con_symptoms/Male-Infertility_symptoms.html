            <p><strong><em>Semen analysis<br>
            <br>
            </em></strong>Semen analysis is the most essential part of diagnosing male infertility. It is a laboratory test of freshly ejaculated semen, of which the number, shape and movement are measured under a microscope. These tests should be done at specialised laboratories that use methods approved by the World Health Organisation.<br>

            Table 2 shows the parameters of normal semen. Based on results of the semen analysis, physical examination and other tests can help to determine the different types of male infertility.</p>
