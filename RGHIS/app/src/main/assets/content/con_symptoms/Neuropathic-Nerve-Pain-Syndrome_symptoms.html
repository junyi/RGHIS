            <p><strong>What causes neuropathic pain?</strong></p>
            <p>Tissue injury from trauma, surgery, infection and even medical diseases may be associated with nerve damage and subsequently lead to neuropathic pain states. Some of the common causes of neuropathic pain include:</p>

                <li>Post-herpetic neuralgia (persistent pain following shingles) </li>
                <li>HIV infection </li>

                <li>Cancer </li>
                <li>Alcoholism </li>
