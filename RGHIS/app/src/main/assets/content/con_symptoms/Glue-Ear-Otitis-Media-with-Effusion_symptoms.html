            Symptoms</span></h2>
            <p>Older children often complain of earache and hearing loss. Younger ones may become fussy, sleep poorly, and often pull and tug at their ear. However, most of the time the children are unaware of the hearing loss. The caregiver may notice that the child turns up the volume of the radio/ TV or is not attentive during normal conversation. Teachers may also complain that the child is inattentive during lessons or is doing poorly in school.</p>

            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>There are several ways of diagnosing OME. Very often, on clinical examination, the eardrums are found to be dull and sometimes bubbles of air may be seen behind them. An audiogram typically shows a mild to moderate conductive hearing loss. </p>
