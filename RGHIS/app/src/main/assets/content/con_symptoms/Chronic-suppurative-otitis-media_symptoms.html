            Symptoms</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Recurrent ear discharge, pain and hearing loss</strong> are the most common symptoms. The ear discharge and pain are due to infection and hearing loss due to perforation of the eardrum and occasionally, erosion of the ossicles in the middle ear. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Part of the skin of the ear grows into the bone of the middle ear</strong> in someone with a cholesteatoma. With chronic infection and as the cholesteatoma grows, it can cause chronic ear discharge, hearing loss, facial paralysis and even meningitis and brain abscess. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>Diagnosis is made from history and examination with an otoscope. An ear perforation can be easily seen. From the exam, the doctor will be able to ensure that you do not have a cholesteatoma. <br>
            <br>
            A hearing test (audiogram) is often necessary. If cholesteatoma is suspected then a CT scan of the temporal bone may be ordered. </p>
