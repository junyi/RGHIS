<h2>What are the investigations? </h2>
<p>When you consult your doctor, a detailed history is first obtained, followed by a comprehensive urogynaecological and neurological examination to ascertain the possible causes of voiding disorders. Various investigations may be ordered and these include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Uroflowmetry:</strong> It measures the rate of urine flow during voiding. </li>
    <li><strong>Residual Urine Volume:</strong> It is the amount of urine remaining in the bladder after voiding. It is measured either by scan or by putting a tube into the bladder to drain out the urine. </li>
    <li><strong>Cystometry:</strong> The bladder pressure is measured during voiding. It can diagnose the bladder muscle that is not contracting normally during voiding. </li>
    <li><strong>Electromyography:</strong> It defects the contractions of the sphincter muscles during voiding. </li>
    <li><strong>Radiology:</strong> It includes X-rays and ultrasound scan to look for tumour, diverticulum and foreign body of the bladder, or enlarged kidneys caused by voiding disorders. </li>
    <li class=last><strong>Cystoscopy:</strong> To look into the bladder and the urethra for foreign body, diverticulum or tumour. </li>
