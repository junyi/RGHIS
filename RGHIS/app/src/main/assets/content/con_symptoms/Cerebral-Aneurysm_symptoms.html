            Symptoms </span></h2>
            <p>Most people with <strong>brain aneurysms</strong> do not experience any symptoms prior to the onset of the rupture. The rupture occurs suddenly. Up to 40% of the people experience 'sentinel headaches days to weeks before the rupture and these are thought to be 'warning leak symptoms. At the time of aneurysm rupture, the following may occur:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sudden onset of severe headache (often described as the &quot;worst&quot; headache of their lives </li>
                <li>Stiff neck </li>
                <li>Nausea and vomiting </li>
                <li>Vision and speech impairment </li>
                <li>Numbness and weakness in any part of the body </li>
