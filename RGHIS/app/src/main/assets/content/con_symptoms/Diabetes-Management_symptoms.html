            <p>People with diabetes are two to four times more likely to develop coronary artery disease and stroke. It is often associated with other cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure, increased total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, decreased HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) cholesterol levels, and obesity.</p>
            <p>Insulin resistance, a condition where the body does not respond efficiently to insulin, can predispose a person to both diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.</p>
            <p>There are two distinct types of diabetes: Type I insulin-dependent diabetes, and Type II non-insulin-dependent diabetes.</p>
            <p>Insulin-dependent diabetes usually develops rapidly and at an early age. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes generally develops more slowly and is more common in sedentary and overweight individuals. There is a tendency for this latter type of diabetes to run in the family.</p>
            <p>Both types of diabetes significantly increase the risk for cardiovascular disease.</p>
