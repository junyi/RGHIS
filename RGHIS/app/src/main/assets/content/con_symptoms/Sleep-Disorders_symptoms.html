            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Risk Factors</span></h2>
            <p>Some sleep disorders such as restless legs syndrome, obstructive sleep apnoea, narcolepsy and the parasomnias have a genetic component and may run in families. </p>
            <p>People who have irregular sleep schedules, including shift workers and those who travel across multiple time zones frequently, are also at increased risk of developing sleep related problems. </p>
            <p>Lifestyle factors such as excessive caffeine consumption, lack of regular exercise, poor stress management and smoking all contribute to sleep disturbances. </p>
            <p>In general, the quality of sleep declines with age. As a result of this, as well as degenerative changes and weight gain which increase with age, sleep related disorders tend to become more frequent as we grow older.</p>

            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>Most sleep disorders can be diagnosed with a good sleep history, including questions about the patients sleep habits, lifestyle, medications and a physical examination. A sleep study may be required in some patients. </p>
