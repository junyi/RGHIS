            <p><strong>Symptoms and Signs of Lymphoma Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            Lymphoma commonly appears as a painless lump that persists or increases in size. A doctor should be seen if there is any painless swelling in the neck, armpits or groin with or without persistent fever, drenching sweats or unexplainable weight loss.</p>

            <p><strong>Diagnostic Tests</strong><br>
            <br>
            Benign conditions can also cause swelling, so a diagnosis of lymphoma is made only after a biopsy (removal of a piece of tissue) of a swelling is done and the tissue examined by a pathologist (doctor who examines tissue under a microscope).</p>
            <p>Once lymphoma is confirmed, further tests, such as scans, biopsy of bone marrow and blood tests may be needed to see how widespread the lymphoma is. Tests of heart function may also be required to see how fit a person is for treatment.</p>

            Types of Lymphoma</span></h2>
            <p>Lymphomas are broadly divided into Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, based on the looks under the microscope. There are many types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The size and shape of the cancer cells and arrangement of the cancer cells in the lymph node determine the type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are further divided into aggressive (high grade) or slow-growing (low-grade) groups. Hodgkin's lymphoma is diagnosed when specific cancer cells are present. </p>
