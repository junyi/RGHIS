Decay in its early stages do not present with symptoms. As decay progresses you may experience:
<ul>
    <li>tooth sensitivity on eating cold or hot food </li>
    <li>pitting or a hole developing in your tooth </li>
    <li>food trap </li>
    <li>pain on biting </li>
    <li>toothache which may be spontaneous </li>
    <li>swelling in the gum (see periapical abscess) </li>
</ul>

<strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Risk Factors</span></strong>
<ul>
    <li>reduced salivary flow <br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'">  </span>this occurs when you do not drink sufficient water, or are dehydrated<br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'">  </span>radiotherapy in the head and neck region can affect salivary glands and the reduce the production of saliva </li>
    <li>poor oral hygiene <br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'"> </span>failure to brush properly results in plaque build up. Bacteria conducive to caries development, thrive in thick plaque </li>
    <li>caries promoting diet <br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'"> </span>diets rich in sugar eg sweet drinks, ice cream, candy enable bacteria to multiply and feed on.<br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'"> </span>acidic food such as cola, juices, directly demineralise tooth structure<br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'"> </span>sticky and starchy food (biscuits, toffee) remain on surfaces of teeth longer and allow bacteria to act on it. </li>
    <li>frequent snacking <br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'"> </span>snacking causes a drop in saliva pH which favours demineralization. Frequent snacking subjects your teeth to frequent acid attack.  </li>
    <li>use of milk bottle (see early childhood caries) <br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'"> </span>lactose in milk is a sugar acted upon by plaque. Sleeping with a milk bottle at night increases a childs risk of developing a severe form of decay called early childhood caries. </li>
    <li>tooth factors <br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'"> </span>defects in teeth such as poorly formed teeth, increase plaque retention and present susceptible surfaces for decay<br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'"> </span>gingival recession exposes root surfaces which are not protected by enamel. </li>
</ul>

<strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Prevention </span></strong><br>
You can prevent decay by dietary and lifestyle changes.
<ul>
    <li>reduce refined sugar in your diet </li>
    <li>avoid snacking in between meals </li>
    <li>if you must snack, use healthier alternatives eg. a fruit or cheese rather than biscuits </li>
    <li>wean your child off the bottle by age 1 (see early childhood caries) </li>
    <li>brush twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste, and floss nightly </li>
    <li>visit your dentist every 6 months. </li>
</ul>
