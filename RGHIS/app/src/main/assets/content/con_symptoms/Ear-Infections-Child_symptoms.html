            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Symptoms </span></h2>
            <p>If your child has <strong>outer ear infection</strong>, he or she may complain of ear pain, itch, difficulty hearing or a blocked ear. There may also be ear discharge.</p>
            <p>If the problem is a <strong>middle ear infection</strong>, your child could have fever, headache, nausea or vomiting and may feel irritable, drowsy and loses his or her appetite. There could be ear pain and hearing difficulty. Young children may pull their ear or poke their fingers inside. Sometimes, the eardrum may rupture and there is a thick and sometimes bloody ear discharge. The perforated eardrum usually heals naturally.</p>
            <p>Some children have recurrent middle ear infection and this can lead to 'glue ear, where there is thick fluid in the ear. 'Glue ear can cause a child to have difficulty in hearing and result in speech, language and other developmental delays as well as behavioural problems like poor attention.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Risk Factors</span></h2>
            <p>Children below three years old are most susceptible to ear infection. Children with weak immune systems are also more likely to get ear infections than healthy children. Family history also plays a part. A child is more likely to have recurrent middle ear infection if a parent or sibling had repeat ear infections.</p>
            <p>Other risk factors include recurrent colds and upper respiratory infections and exposure to cigarette smoke. Being in a childcare centre with other children also increases risk as viruses can spread quickly among the children, causing colds that could lead to ear infections. </p>
            <p><strong>Primary risk factors: <br>
            </strong>Age, weakened immune systems and family history of ear infection. </p>
            <p><strong>Secondary risk factors:<br>
            </strong>Recurrent colds and upper respiratory infections, exposure to cigarette smoke and being in a childcare centre with other children.</p>
