            <br>
            <p>Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) causes joint stiffness, pain and swelling and possibly other organ damage. The joints affected and severity of joint or other organ inflammation varies between people. <br>
            <br>
            Sometimes, a person may not realise for a long period of time that he has RA because the symptoms may be as subtle as persistent tiredness and mild joint stiffness.</p>

            <p>RA affects all races and 75% of patients are female. The age at which RA most frequently begins is between 20 and 45 years old. Although the exact cause for RA is unknown, it seems that certain people inherit the tendency to develop RA. <br>
            <br>
            That means that your children will be more likely to develop RA if you suffer from RA but the risk is still low. </p>

            <p>In order to diagnose RA accurately, a doctor must evaluate the patient and usually also perform blood tests and x-rays. It is very important to diagnose RA as early as possible as research has shown that prompt treatment improves the chances for the patient to be treated eff ectively so that the joint and organs remain healthy and not permanently damaged. Referral to a rheumatologist (a specialist doctor who looks after patients with rheumatic disease) is often helpful for confi rmation of RA and treatment.</p>
