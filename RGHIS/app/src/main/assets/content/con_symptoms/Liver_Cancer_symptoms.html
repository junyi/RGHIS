            A simple blood test for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) may detect liver cancer. Levels below 10 are normal. In up to 30% of patients with liver cancer, the AFP can be normal. Other causes of a raised AFP include early childhood, liver damage from hepatitis, or tumoursР’В in the testes. <br>

            The simplest imaging study of the liver is an ultrasound. This has no radiation risk and can be done on a regular basis, especially in individuals who are at risk of liver cancer, for e.g. hepatitis B carriers who are screened regularly for liver cancer. It is however not always accurate and is dependent on the skill of the person doing the ultrasound scan.<br>

            A CT scan is a better way of detecting liver cancer and is crucial for planning for treatment. This would be the basic imaging that will be done by the liver surgeon to detect and plan a treatment strategy for liver cancer. In certain cases, a CT scan may not be enough or is inconclusive, and additional investigations like MRI or angiograms may be performed.<br>

On occasions, a CT scan may not be enough or is inconclusive, and additional investigations like MRI or PET-CT scans may be performed. An MRI is like a CT scan, but uses magnetic forces instead of radiation. </p>
