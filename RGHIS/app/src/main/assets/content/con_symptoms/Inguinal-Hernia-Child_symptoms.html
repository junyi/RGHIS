            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Symptoms </span></h2>
            <p>Hernias may not be obvious until after several weeks or months after birth. It appears as a swelling or bulge over the groin area or the scrotum; bigger and more noticeable when the baby is crying or straining. It becomes serious when the bulge cannot be pushed back into the abdomen; the loop of bowel stuck in the inguinal canal will lose its blood supply. Symptoms may vary for each child but common signs include a rounded or tense abdomen, vomiting, pain or fussiness, redness or discoloration and fever.</p>
