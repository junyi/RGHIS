            Symptoms </span></h2>
            <p>The pain, which comes and goes, feels like bursts of sharp, stabbing, electrical shocks involving the cheek, nose, upper lip or the jaw. In almost all cases (more than 95%), pain will be restricted to one side of your face. This pain can last from a few seconds to a few minutes. Common daily activities such as eating, drinking or brushing the teeth can bring on the pain.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>If you show symptoms trigeminal neuralgia, you should see a doctor to confirm the diagnosis. Your doctor will conduct an interview and physical examination, and may ask you specific questions regarding the pain  including onset, nature and triggering factors. He may also arrange for you to have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. </p>
            <p>You may be referred to a <strong>neurosurgeon</strong> if deemed necessary.</p>
