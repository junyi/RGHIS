            <p><strong>1. Blurring vision <br>
            </strong>It is caused by direct pressure from the tumour itself. As the tumour grows, it puts pressure on the optic nerve, which often caused blurring vision. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>2. Hypopituitarism <br>
            </strong>It results in amenorrhoea (no menstruation), cold intolerance, general weakness, etc. <br>
            <br>
            3. Others symptoms which take may develop as the result of excessive hormones production include: <br>
            <br>
            <strong> Gigantism<br>
            </strong>It happens to the younger group of patients before bones mature if the tumour produces excessive amount of growth hormone. <br>
            <br>
            <strong> Acromegaly <br>
            </strong>It causes enlargement of lip, hand and feet, also lead to high blood pressure and diabetes if the tumour produces excessive amount of growth hormone. <br>
            <br>
            <strong> Moon face,</strong> <strong>weight gain, increase facial hair in women and mental changes. </strong><br>
            Excessive Adreno-Corticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulates the adrenal gland to make and secrete glucocorticoids. Excessive amounts of glucocorticoid hormones causes build up of fats in the face, neck, trunk, weight gain, increased facial hair in women and mental changes such as depression. Excessive amount of sugar (Diabetes Mellitus) and high blood pressure may occur. <br>
            <br>
             <strong>Irregularity of menstruation, loss of sexual function, infertility and general weakness</strong>. <br>
            Due to excessive production of prolactin, there may be irregular menstruation, inappropriate milk production by the breast (galactorrhoea) and infertility in women; impotence and infertility in men. </p>
