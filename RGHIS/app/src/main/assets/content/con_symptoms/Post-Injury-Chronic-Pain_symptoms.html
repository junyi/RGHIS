            <p><strong>How does CRPS present?</strong></p>
            <p>CRPS usually affects one or more extremities, but may affect any part of the body. Pain is constant, sharp, burning, pricking or shooting in nature. There may be associated numbness and increased sensitivity to touch. Wearing socks over the affected foot can be extremely painful and intolerable. The affected arm or leg may even appear warm and flushed or cold and blue. Swelling and loss of hair can also occur. In chronic cases, X-RAY may also demonstrate osteoporosis after one to two months from the onset of CRPS.</p>
