            <p>The most common symptom is pain while putting weight on the affected hip, such as during walking or even sitting for prolonged periods of time. The pain is typically felt in the groin area or buttocks, or sometimes over the front of the thigh.<br>
            <br>
            You may limp, which is the body's way of reducing the amount of force that the hip has to withstand. Your hip may also feel stiff , and this will cause difficulty with certain activities such as getting into or out of a low chair or a car, or using the toilet. <br>
            <br>
            You may also experience difficulties with crossing over low obstacles on the ground. Finally, as the condition becomes worse, pain may be present all the time and may even keep you awake at night.</p>

            <p>The diagnosis of hip OA starts with a complete history and physical examination by your doctor. X-rays will be required to determine the extent of the joint damage and can also help the doctor find a possible cause for it. <br>
            <br>
            Other tests may be required if there is reason to believe that other conditions are contributing to the degenerative process. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be necessary to determine whether your hip condition is from problems with AVN. Blood tests may be required to rule out other forms of arthritis or infection in the hip.</p>
