            <p>In spondyloarthritis, there is inflammation of the spine, joints and entheses. If it involves fingers and toes, they may swell and take the appearance of 'sausage digits. <br>
            <br>
            All of these diseases display a variety of symptoms and signs, but they share many similarities, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sacroiliitis (inflammation of the joint between the pelvis and the spine) and spondylitis (inflammation of the joints between the spine) </li>
                <li>Presence of enthesitis (inflammation of an entheses) (defined above) </li>
                <li>Absence of positive blood test for rheumatoid factor ('seronegative) </li>
                <li>A tendency to occur in more than one family member </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)</strong></p>
            <p>Ankylosing Spondylitis is a long-term disease that affects the joints in the spine, pelvis and, often, the peripheral joints such as hips, knees, ankles and feet as well. The main problem is chronic inflammation that may eventually cause the spine to fuse together. <br>
            <br>
            The condition usually starts with low back pain that is worse at night, in the morning, or after prolonged inactivity, and tends to improve with exercise. Limited expansion in the chest may occur as a result of inflammation of the joints between the ribs. As the disease progresses, any portion of the spine may be affected. <br>
            <br>
            The disease affects more males than females although females can also be affected. It tends to begin between age 20 and 40. Risk factors include having an affected family member and male gender.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><em>Diagnosis on Symptoms <br>
            </em></strong>It is important that you give a detailed history of your symptoms to your doctor as, often, the diagnosis can be made based on your symptoms. Specific symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis include stooped posture and back pain that is worse at night, in the morning or after inactivity. <br>
            <br>
            Neck, hip and heel pain, pain and swelling in the shoulders, knees and ankles, stiffness in the back, limited chest expansion and range of motion involving the spine and hips, fatigue, mild fever, loss of appetite, loss of weight are also symptoms. Other uncommon complications include eye inflammation, lung fibrosis and disease of heart valves.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Psoriatic Arthritis<br>
            <br>
            </strong>Psoriasis is a scaly rash that can affect any part of the body, but most frequently the elbows, knees and scalp. In about 5 - 10% of patients with psoriasis, arthritis may also occur, giving rise to psoriatic arthritis. Apart from involvement of the spine, pelvis and joints, psoriatic arthritis is often accompanied by changes in the finger nails and toe nails such as the appearance of small pits.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Enteropathic Arthritis<br>
            <br>
            </strong>Enteropathic arthritis is a form of spondyloarthritis that is associated with inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis, which typically causes inflammation of the intestines. About 1 in 6 people with inflammatory bowel disease will develop enteropathic arthritis affecting the spine and joints.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Reactive Arthritis<br>
            </strong><br>
            Reactive arthritis refers to a type of spondyloarthritis that may be triggered by certain germs which cause gastroenteritis or urinary tract infections. Reiters syndrome is a form of reactive arthritis which may also affect the eyes and the skin.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Undifferentiated Spondyloarthritis<br>
            <br>
            </strong>Not all patients have classic signs and symptoms that fit neatly into one of the categories outlined above, especially at the start of the illness. In such cases, the term, undifferentiated spondyloarthritis may be used.</p>
