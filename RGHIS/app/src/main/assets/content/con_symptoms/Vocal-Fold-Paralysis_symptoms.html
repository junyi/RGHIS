            <p>As with other voice disorders, examination of the vocal folds with nasoendoscopy or videostroboscopy may be required (see page 38). Other investigations may include CT or MRI scanning to look for the cause of the paralysis. The specialist may also discuss transnasal oesophagoscopy to examine the food passage (this can be carried out in the clinic); and laryngeal electromyography, which uses a fine needle to measure function of the vocal fold muscle. </p>
