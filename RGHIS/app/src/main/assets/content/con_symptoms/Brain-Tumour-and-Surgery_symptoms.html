            Symptoms </span></h2>
            <p>The symptoms may be generalized or localised.</p>
            <p>Generalised symptoms are due to increased pressure exerted on the brain and include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A recurring headache that may worse in the morning </li>
                <li>Nausea and vomiting </li>
                <li>Seizures </li>
                <li>Increased drowsiness </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Localised symptoms depend on the location of the tumour and include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Progressive weakness or numbness in the arms or legs </li>
                <li>Progressive difficulty with speech, hearing, concentration or vision, including double-vision </li>
                <li>Memory loss or a change in memory </li>
                <li>A significant change in personality or behaviour </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some of these symptoms may also be caused by other conditions besides brain tumours. It is therefore wise to seek a neurosurgical opinion should the symptoms persist. </p>

            Risk Factors</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Risk of Developing Brain Tumours</strong></p>
            <p>Brain tumours may occur at any age, but the tumours that occur in childhood are generally different from those diagnosed in adults. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p><strong>How are Brain Tumours Diagnosed?</strong></p>
            <p>A detailed clinical assessment including history of the symptoms and a physical examination, including a comprehensive neurological examination, is necessary. Specialised imaging tests such as Computed Tomography (CT scan), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will usually be performed. Occasional, special tests like cerebral angiogram (X-rays of the blood vessels of the brain), functional MRI scans and MRI tractography may be required. <br>
            <br>
            These tests will reveal the tumours size, location and also proximity to critical structures such as the speech or motor areas of the brain. The information will provide the neurosurgeon with a tentative diagnosis of the type of tumour and to aid him to plan the surgical approach for its removal.</p>
