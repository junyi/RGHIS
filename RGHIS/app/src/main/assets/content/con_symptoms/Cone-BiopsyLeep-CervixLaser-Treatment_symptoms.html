<h2>Why Is It Performed?</h2>
<p>A cone biopsy or leep is performed when:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There are precancerous changes of the cervix. </li>
    <li>The entire abnormal area cannot be fully seen at colposcopy. This may occur when the abnormality extends into the cervical canal. This is the canal that leads from the vagina through the cervix and into the uterus. </li>
    <li>The PAP smear repeatedly shows abnormal cells although the colposcopy reveals normal results. This may mean that the abnormal cells are from the endocervical canal. </li>
    <li>The doctor is concerned that the abnormal cells show signs of a very early cancer. </li>
</ul>
