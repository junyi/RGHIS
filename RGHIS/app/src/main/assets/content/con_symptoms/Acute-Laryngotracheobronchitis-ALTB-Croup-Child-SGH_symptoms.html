            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Symptoms </span></h2>
            <p>Most children with viral croup are between the ages of three months and five years old. Croup is most likely to occur during the winter months and early spring. Symptoms are most severe in children younger than three years of age.</p>
            <p>Croup often begins like a normal cold followed by a harsh and barking cough, described as &quot;croupy&quot;. This often happens at night when the air is cooler. Croup from a viral infection usually lasts less than a week. Croup rarely causes any long-term complications.</p></div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Symptoms>
            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Risk Factors</span></h2>
            <p>Children who were born prematurely or who have a history of breathing problems or asthma are more likely to develop severe croup and may require hospitalisation.</p></div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Symptoms>
            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Prevention</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Croup</strong> is a contagious disease and can be spread easily from one person to another. If possible, avoid contact with others who have colds and flu. Good personal hygiene such as frequent hand washing helps to reduce the chance of spreading the infection. Always have your child cough or sneeze into a tissue and throw it away immediately. It also helps to increase the amount of fluids your child drinks. </p></div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Symptoms>
            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">When To Seek Help</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Croup</strong> can get worse quickly. If your child is having problems breathing, he or she should get medical help as soon as possible. If your child has croup, you should consider sleeping overnight in the same room to observe him or her closely. If you are not able to ease your child's shortness of breath and croupy cough, call your child's doctor or seek medical attention as soon as possible.</p></div>
