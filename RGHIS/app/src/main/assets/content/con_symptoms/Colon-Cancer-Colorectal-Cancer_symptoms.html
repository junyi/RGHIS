            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Diagnostic Tests</strong><br>
            <br>
            The simplest way to detect a rectal cancer is by insertion of the doctor's finger into the rectum, i.e. a rectal examination. This can be done in the outpatient clinic, takes less than 5 minutes and causes minimal discomfort. However, this detects cancers only in the last 5 to 8 cm of the rectum.</p>
            <p>For cancers which are more distantly located in the large intestine, sigmoidoscope or colonoscope examination can be performed. These fiber-optic flexible tubes are inserted up the rectum into the colon. Through these scopes, removal of a small piece of growth for testing is possible. Insertion of these scopes are performed with minimal anaesthesia in an outpatient clinic. Although uncomfortable, the procedure lasts less than 30 minutes.</p>
            <p>Barium enema is an x-ray examination performed to examine the whole length of the large intestine. A dye is passed through a narrow tube into the rectum and allowed to coat the length of the intestine. Multiple x-ray films are taken on various portions of the large intestine and abnormal areas identified. The doctor may further proceed to do a colonoscopy or a sigmoidoscopy so that a biopsy of these suspicious areas can be done. </p>
