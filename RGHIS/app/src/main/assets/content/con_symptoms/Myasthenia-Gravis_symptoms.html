            Symptoms </span></h2>
            <br>
            <strong>Myasthenia Gravis </strong>can affect any skeletal muscle in the body. It can be: <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Generalised</strong>, i.e. affecting muscles that control eyelids, eye movements, facial expression, chewing, swallowing (dysphagia), speech (dysarthria), respiration and limbs. </li>
                <li><strong>Localised</strong>, e.g. in Ocular MG, only the eyelid and eye movement muscles are affected. </li>
            </ul>
            Not all the abovementioned symptoms are present in every patient or at the same time. The two most common symptoms are intermittent drooping of eyelids (ptosis) and double vision (diplopia), which are precipitated by fatigue and relieved by rest. <br>
            <br>
            Limb weakness usually involves the proximal limb muscles and is worse with repeated activity and at the end of the day. Patients would notice difficulty keeping their arms above their head and getting up from the chair. Some complain of shortness of breath, with exertion or when lying flat. <br>
            <br>
            The onset of symptoms is usually gradual but it can be sudden, with rapid deterioration of swallowing, breathing and generalised weakness. This is termed myasthenic crisis and it often requires hospitalisation and urgent treatment. Infection and sudden withdrawal of treatment are common triggers.</div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Symptoms>

            Causes </span></h2>
            <p><strong>Myasthenia Gravis</strong> affects all ethnic groups and both genders. It is more common in young adult women (under 40 years old) and older men (over 60 years old) but can affect all age groups. It can also occur in the newborn (usually from a myasthenic mother who passes the antibodies to the fetus) and children. In adults, MG is usually not hereditary. It is not contagious.</p>
