            <p><strong><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes and Risk Factors </span></strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blood is supplied to the brain by blood vessels called arteries. These arteries may get blocked, causing an “ischaemic stroke” or “infarct”. Less commonly, these arteries may burst, causing a “haemorrhagic stroke” or “brain haemorrhage”. </li>
                <li>There are a number of factors that increase the risk of stroke: </li>
                <li>Older age </li>
                <li>Male gender </li>
                <li>high blood pressure(hypertension) </li>
                <li>Cigarette smoking </li>
                <li>Diabetes mellitus </li>
                <li>High cholesterol </li>
                <li>Irregular heart beat (atrial fibrillation) </li>
                <li>Certain heart diseases including a recent heart attack </li>
                <li>Previous stroke or TIA </li>
            </ul>

                <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Diagnosis</span></h2>
                <p>A number of tests are done, including: <br>
                <br>
                <strong>a) Brain scan:</strong> Usually a CT scan is performed. Sometimes an MRI scan is needed. The scan will help the doctor confirm the type of stroke and its location. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>b) Blood tests</strong>: To look for underlying diseases such as diabetes mellitus and high cholesterol. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>c) Chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG):</strong> For information on heart diseases. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>d) Ultrasound</strong> studies of the blood vessels in the neck and skull (carotid ultrasound, transcranial Doppler), and of the heart (echocardiogram): To detect conditions that may be predisposed to stroke. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>e) Angiogram:</strong> A small tube is inserted into the groin and passed along the blood vessel till it reaches the brain. A dye is injected and X-ray pictures are taken. These provide information on the location and severity of vessel blockage or bleed. </p>
