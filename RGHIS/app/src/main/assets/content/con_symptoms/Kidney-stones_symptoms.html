            Symptoms</span></h2>
            <p>Many people may not feel any symptoms. The first symptom of a kidney stone is severe pain, which begins suddenly when a stone moves in the urinary tract and blocks the flow of urine. </p>
            <p>Typically, you will feel a sharp, cramping pain in your back and side, and around the area of the kidney. The pain may shift to the lower abdomen later on. Sometimes, you may also experience nausea and vomiting. </p>
            <p>As the stone moves and the body tries to push it out, blood may appear in your urine making the urine pink. As the stone moves down the ureter closer to the bladder, you may feel the need to urinate more often or a burning sensation during urination. If fever and chills accompany any of these symptoms, an infection may be present. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>This requires imaging of the urinary tract, which includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>X-ray or ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder, or</strong> </li>
                <li><strong>Intravenous urogram (IVU) or computerised tomography (CT) scan </strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additional urine and blood tests may be needed to exclude infection and impairment of kidney function.</p>
            <p>You may be asked to collect urine for 24 hours to measure urine volume and the levels of chemicals in the urine. Your doctor will also ask about your medical history, occupation, and eating habits.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
            Prevention</span></h2>
            <p>You are likely to form another if you have had more than one kidney stone. Therefore, prevention is important. </p>
            <p><strong>Adequate water intake.</strong> If you tend to form stones, try to drink enough liquid throughout the day to produce at least two litres of clear urine. </p>
            <p><strong>Calcium intake.</strong> In the past, people who form calcium stones were told to avoid dairy products and other foods with high calcium content. Recent studies have shown that foods high in calcium, including dairy products, may help prevent calcium stones. Older women taking calcium supplements to prevent bone loss should continue to do so.</p>
            <p><strong>Oxalate intake.</strong> If you are prone to forming calcium oxalate stones you may be asked by your doctor to limit or avoid certain foods if your urine contains an excess of oxalate. Foods that have medium amounts of oxalate may be eaten in limited amounts.</p>
            <p><strong>Vitamin D intake.</strong> You may be told to avoid food with added vitamin D and certain types of antacids that have a calcium base. </p>
            <p><strong>Meat intake.</strong> If you have highly acidic urine you may need to eat less meat, fish, and poultry as these foods increase the amount of acid in the urine.<br>
