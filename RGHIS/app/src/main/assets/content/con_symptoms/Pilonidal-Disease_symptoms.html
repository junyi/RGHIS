            <p>Symptoms vary from a small dimple to a large painful mass. There may be a discharge that is clear, cloudy or bloody. When infected, the area becomes red and painful. There may also be fever.</p>
            <p>Nearly all patients have an episode of an acute infection (the area is swollen, tender, and may drain pus). After the infection settles, many patients develop a sinus, which is a cavity below the skin surface that connects to the surface through one or more small openings. Most patients will need a small operation to remove the sinus.</p>
            <p>Some patients get repeated infections and inflammation of these sinus tracts, resulting in episodes of swelling, pain, and discharge of pus. Surgery is almost always required to resolve this condition.</p>
