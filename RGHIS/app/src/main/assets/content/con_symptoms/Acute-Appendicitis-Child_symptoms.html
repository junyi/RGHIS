<h2>Common Symptoms Of Appendicitis</h2>
<p>The most common symptoms of appendicitis are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abdominal pain which is initially central and later moves to the right lower part of the abdomen. </li>
    <li>Nausea with or without vomiting. </li>
    <li>Loss of appetite. </li>
    <li class=last>Slight fever. </li>
</ul>
<p>If the infection of the appendix remains untreated, the appendix may perforate. This may lead to inflammation throughout the abdomen and blood infection, both of which may endanger the child's life.</p>
<h2>Frequency</h2>
<p>Acute appendicitis can occur in all age groups. It is estimated that it will eventually affect 5 - 7% of the general population. The likelihood of perforation in children is much higher than in adults.</p>

<h2>How Is Appendicitis Diagnosed?</h2>
<p>When the child is brought to the hospital, the doctor will do a complete physical examination on the child. Blood may be taken for investigation. Occasionally, an ultrasound or a computerised tomography scan (CT scan) may be done to help with the diagnosis, but usually a physical examination is enough. Your child will not be allowed to eat or drink for a few hours. This is to prepare for surgery. Once your child has been diagnosed to have acute appendicitis, an urgent operation will be required.</p>
