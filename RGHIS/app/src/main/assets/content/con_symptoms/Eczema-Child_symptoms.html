<h2>What Does Eczema Look Like?</h2>
<p>In babies, it is on the face and joints, like elbow and knee joints. The skin becomes itchy, red, swollen with small blisters. If the child scratches, it becomes sore and broken. The skin bleeds and gets infected by bacteria. Even after it heals, it tends to recur.</p>
