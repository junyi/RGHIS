<h2>Benefits</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Happier Baby</strong><br>
    Skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth keeps the baby warm and calm. The baby cries less and has a more stable heart rate, breathing pattern, blood oxygen and sugar levels. </li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced Bonding</strong><br>
    In research studies, mothers with skin-to-skin contact with their babies have demonstrated better bonding with increased affection and attachment behaviour. </li>
    <li><strong>Better Breastfeeding</strong><br>
    Skin-to-skin contact promotes breastfeeding immediately after birth. It takes advantage of the babys early alertness and innate behaviour to latch on to the breast, often without assistance. </li>
</ul>
