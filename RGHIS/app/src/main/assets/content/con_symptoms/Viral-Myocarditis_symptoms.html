            <p>Viral myocarditis is usually preceded by flu-like symptoms with fever, fatigue and palpitations. The diagnosis is difficult as the initial symptoms may be mistaken as a flu. It is usually when the patient presents with symptoms of heart failure (e.g. breathlessness) or abnormal ECG (Electrocardiogram) readings that lead to the diagnosis. Occasionally, it can also be mistaken as a heart attack.</p>

            <p>The diagnosis of myocarditis is usually based on diagnosis of exclusion because there are many causes of heart failure. Definite diagnosis of viral myocarditis can only be made with biopsy of the heart muscle, which is a high-risk test. However, there are usually some ECG and blood test abnormalities showing signs of heart muscle damage, while ultrasound of the heart (echocardiography) may show a dilated and weakened heart. Antibody to the virus may be high in patients with viral myocarditis and can be detected in the blood after a few weeks.</p>
