            <p>The symptoms of acute aortic dissection are usually dramatic with sudden, severe ripping chest or back pain. The pain may travel if there is extension of the dissection.</p>
            <p>Other symptoms, depending on whether the origins of major arteries are involved, include heart attack, stroke, heart failure or shock. </p>

            <p>Patients with severe chest or back pain, especially those suffering from high blood pressure, are suspected of having aortic dissection. Chest X-ray showing widening of the tissue in the middle of the chest is suggestive of aortic dissection. However, CT (Computed Tomography) scan, MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) or ultrasound is usually needed to confirm the diagnosis.</p>
