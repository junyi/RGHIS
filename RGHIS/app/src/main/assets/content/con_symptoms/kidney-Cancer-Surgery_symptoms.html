            <p>The majority of those with kidney cancers are diagnosed when they are investigated for other complaints, even though they have no specific symptoms related to the disease. Kidney cancer diagnosed this way is usually small and at an early stage. On the other hand, about a third of all those with the disease will present late with the disease at an advanced stage. <br>
            <br>
            Possible signs of symptomatic renal cell cancer include :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blood in the urine </li>
                <li>A mass in the abdomen </li>
                <li>A pain in the side that does not go away </li>
                <li>Loss of appetite or weight loss for no known reason </li>
                <li>Anaemia (low blood count) </li>
            </ul>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>Further tests to confirm the presence and extent of kidney cancer may include :</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ultrasound or Computed Tomography (CT) scan.</strong> Detailed images are taken of the kidney to show the size, characteristics and extent of spread of the kidney tumour. </li>
                <li><strong>Kidney biopsy.</strong> Samples of kidney tumour tissue are removed and examined under the microscope to confi rm presence of cancer. </li>
                <li><strong>Cystoscopy.</strong> A small tube, a cystoscope, is passed through the opening of the urethra in the penis. It contains a lens and light system that helps the doctor see the inside of the urethra, prostate and the bladder to identify any additional tumours in those who have blood in the urine and a kidney tumour. </li>
            </ul>
