<h2>How Does Your Bladder Work?</h2>
<p>Urine is formed when our kidneys remove waste and water from the blood. Urine flows downward from the kidneys through a pair of tubes called the ureters, into our bladder, which is a balloon-like structure located in the pelvis.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"></p>
<p>During urination, we empty our bladder when urine leaves the bladder through a tube called the urethra. The urethra is controlled by sphincter muscles. When the sphincter muscles relax, they open and allow urine to flow out. At the same time, the muscles of the bladder wall (i.e. detrusor muscles) contract to force the urine out. After urination, the sphincter muscles contract and close the urethra while the bladder stops contracting and relaxes.</p>
