            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
            Risk Factors</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Anatomic abnormality.</strong> Snoring and OSA occur because of anatomic abnormality in the upper airway leading to obstruction. <br>
            <br>
            The sites involved include the : </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nose (enlarged turbinates, deviated nasal septum, and nasal polyps) </li>
                <li>Oropharynx (long, redundant and thick palate and uvula, large tonsils) </li>
                <li>Hypopharynx/base of tongue (lingual tonsillar hypertrophy, fl oppy epiglottis, and bulky tongue) and throat </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Genetics.</strong> Genetic predisposition leading to facial and jaw abnormalities are known predisposing risk factors. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Medications / Alcohol.</strong> Mild or intermittent snoring may be a result of medications (like sedatives to help you sleep) or alcohol that induce relaxation of the upper airway muscles. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Weight.</strong> Weight gain can contribute to snoring and OSA. Excessive fat accumulation in the upper airway can amplify an existing anatomic narrowing that was causing mild obstruction previously. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Gender and Age.</strong> The male gender and increased age are risk factors. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>Individuals who snore persistently (night after night) should be referred to a Otolaryngologist, who will perform a comprehensive clinical evaluation including an endoscopic upper airway evaluation to determine an appropriate treatment plan. This evaluation includes a sleep study/ polysomnogram as the patients own history of apnoea or sleepiness may be inaccurate, and patients with OSA almost always snore. </p>
