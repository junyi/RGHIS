            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>The ENT surgeon will take a complete history and physical examination of the head and neck including the various nerves in the area. <br>
            <br>
            See an ENT specialist to determine the actual cause of your tinnitus. </p>
            <p>A hearing test (audiogram) will be performed. Depending on the symptoms and examination as well as the type of tinnitus, other investigations may be needed. These can include either a special audiogram known as an auditory brainstem response (ABR), a brain scan such as a computerised tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. </p>
