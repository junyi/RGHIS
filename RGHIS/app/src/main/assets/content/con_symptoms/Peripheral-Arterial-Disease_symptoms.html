            <p>The symptom involves intermittent claudication, or momentary limping because of pain. For example, when a patient with a blockage in his leg walks 100 metres, he starts developing pain in the calf muscle of the affected leg. He stops and rest for a few minutes; the pain goes away and he can go another 100 metres before it comes on again.<br>
            <br>
            In the most extreme cases, if left unchecked, it can cause ulcers, gangrene, and amputation. </p>
