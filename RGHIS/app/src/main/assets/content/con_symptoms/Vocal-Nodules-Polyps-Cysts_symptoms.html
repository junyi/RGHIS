            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>Diagnosis is made by taking a history of the voice problem and by physical examination. Your specialist may pass a nasoendoscope through the nose down to the voice box under local anaesthesia. A more detailed examination is sometimes needed using videostroboscopy. In this procedure, a rigid telescope tube with a stroboscopic light is passed through the mouth (after spraying the throat with anaesthetic) to view the voice box. Other medical conditions that can contribute to the voice problem such as acid reflux, allergic rhinitis (sensitive nose) and sinusitis may need to be evaluated separately. </p>
