            <ul>
                <li>Sore throat </li>
                <li>Fever </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If tonsillitis occurs, you will experience: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Severe sore throat </li>
                <li>Painful and difficult swallowing </li>
                <li>Referred pain to the ear </li>
                <li>Fever and chills </li>
                <li>Loss of voice (due to inflammation of voice box) </li>
                <li>Headache </li>
                <li>Tender and enlarged lymph glands in the neck </li>
                <li>Red and swollen tonsils and white patches on the tonsils </li>

            <p><strong><span style="color:#000000">Complications <br>
            <br>
            </span></strong>Acute tonsillitis itself is usually not serious but can lead to complications if left untreated. Swollen tonsils can block the airway and cause airway obstruction leading to sleep apnoea. <br>
            <br>
            The infection may spread to the surrounding tissue and neck and result in the collection of pus between the tonsil and tissues around it (peritonsillar infection and abscess). It can also spread to the neck causing pus collection in the neck (parapharyngeal abscess and retropharyngeal space abscess). You can present with difficulty swallowing, drooling, stiff neck or pain and difficulty breathing. </p>

            Prevention</span></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The viruses and bacteria that cause pharyngitis and tonsillitis are contagious. Personal hygiene is important to prevent infections and frequent hand washing is the best way. Wash your hands often, and encourage your children to do the same. </li>
                <li>Other precautionary measures include not sharing drinking glasses or eating utensils, covering the mouth when sneezing or coughing and avoiding close contact with anyone who is sick. </li>
                <li>Parents should keep their children at home if they are sick to prevent spreading the germs. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Diagnosis</span></h2>
