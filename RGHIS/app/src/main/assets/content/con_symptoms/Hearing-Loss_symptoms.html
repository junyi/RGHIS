            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Prevention</span></h2>
            <p>Noise-induced hearing loss is usually irreversible and progresses with each exposure. People who work with heavy machinery or in the construction industry should use proper ear protection when working around loud noises, especially when working for prolonged periods. They should also undergo regular hearing tests to ensure that their hearing is not worsening.Youngsters should not use earphones or visit discotheques.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>A complete history, ENT examination and relevant investigations are necessary for a diagnosis. The ENT physician will perform a thorough head and neck examination, particularly of the ear canal and tympanic membrane. An endoscopic examination of the nose and nasopharynx may also be necessary. Occasionally, a neurologic examination will be done. <br>
            <br>
            A hearing test (audiogram) will be performed to confirm the presence and indicate the severity and type of hearing loss. A tympanogram may also be performed to detect problems of the eardrum and middle ear. Radiological imaging studies such as CT scans or MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging) may be ordered to detect an acoustic neuroma. </p>
