<h2>How Do You Know If Your Child Has HFMD?</h2>
<p>Children with HFMD will have blister-like or <strong>pimple-like</strong> rash on their hands, feet and buttocks, mouth ulcers and fever. In addition, the child may have a sore throat, runny nose, experience vomiting and diarrhoea, and may feel tired.</p>
<p>You may bring your child to the polyclinic or see your family doctor. There is no need to rush your child to the Children's Emergency just to confirm the diagnosis of HFMD.</p>
<h2>How Can Your Child Get HFMD?</h2>
<p>HFMD can be easily spread through direct contact with nose discharge, saliva, faeces and fluid from the blisters.</p>
<h2>Is This Disease Serious?</h2>
<p>The disease is usually mild and most children will recover in about a weeks time. Only very rarely do certain rare strains of the virus cause complications such as inflammation of the brain and heart.</p>
