<h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Asymmetrical head shape &gt; 6weeks after birth. </li>
    <li>Flattened spot at the back or side of the head </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Causes</h2>
<p>This can be caused by the position of the baby in the uterus during pregnancy, or can happen during birth. The bones of a newborn baby's head are thin and flexible so the head is soft and may change shape easily. Flattening of the head in one area may happen if a baby lies with its head in the same position for a long time.</p>
<h2>Complications</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Facial Asymmetry </li>
    <li>Torticollis </li>
    <li>Contracture of neck muscles </li>
    <li>Jaw and / or speech clarity problems </li>
</ul>
