<h2>How do I know if my child has lazy eye (amblyopia)?</h2>
<p>Children with amblyopia often do not complain of poor vision, and a problem is sometimes first noted when vision in both eyes is tested (eg. in school visual screening). Occasionally, parents will notice a squint (strabismus) when one eye appears to be misaligned. Under certain conditions (eg. where there is strabismus, droopy eye lid, or obstruction to the visual axis), your doctor may need to screen your child regularly for amblyopia. </p>

<h2>What puts my child at risk of lazy eye (amblyopia)?</h2>
<p>Your child is at a higher risk if he or she has:</p>
<p>- High amounts of astigmatism, long-sightedness (hyperopia) or short-sightedness (myopia)<br>
- Large differences in spectacle power between the two eyes<br>
- Obstruction of vision by congenital defects such as droopy eyelid (ptosis), cataracts or other<br>
  lesions in the eye<br>
- Strabismus or squints where the eye that is misaligned is not used </p>

<h2>What kinds of treatments are available for lazy eye (amblyopia)? </h2>
<p>Firstly, if there is abnormal spectacle power, the child needs to be given appropriate spectacles which need to be worn all the time. Next, the child need to be encouraged to use the lazy eye. This is usually done by patching or covering the good eye, often for several hours per day. Treatment may take months, and even years, and is often more effective when it is started earlier. When amblyopia is detected too late (eg. after the age of 8 years), it may not be possible to reverse the visual damage. It is therefore important that you have your child checked if you or the school health services suspects or picks up a potential problem. </p>
