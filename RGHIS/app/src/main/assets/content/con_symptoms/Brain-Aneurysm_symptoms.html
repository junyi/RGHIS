            Symptoms</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p><strong>What are the symptoms? </strong></p>
            Most people with brain aneurysm may not experience any symptom until it ruptures or becomes fairly large. Up to 40% of the people experience 'sentinel headaches days to weeks before the aneurysm rupture. This is due to small 'warning leak from the aneurysm. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            A large aneurysm may exert pressure on a nerve or surrounding brain tissue and may cause pupillary dilatation, visual disturbance, numbness, weakness, or paralysis on one side of the face or eye pain. <br>
            <br>
            At the time of aneurysm rupture, the following may occur: <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Sudden onset of severe headache (often described as the 'worst' headache of their lives) </li>
                <li>Nausea and/or vomiting </li>
                <li>Change in mental state or loss of consciousness </li>
                <li>Seizure </li>
                <li>Stiff neck </li>
                <li>Sensitivity to light </li>
                <li>Vision and/or speech impairment </li>
                <li>Numbness and/or weakness in any part of body </li>
            </ul>
            (Any of these symptoms can be very serious. Emergency medical attention should be sought immediately). </div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Symptoms>
            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p><strong>How is brain aneurysm diagnosed?<br>
            </strong><br>
            Most brain aneurysms may be undetected until they rupture. They can also be detected incidentally by brain imaging that is performed for another condition. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Computed Tomography (CT) <br>
            </strong>Brain CT scan of the head is a fast, painless, non-invasive diagnostic tool that can detect blood in the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage) when one has the symptoms mentioned above. This is often the first diagnostic procedure for detecting aneurysm rupture. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Cerebral Angiography <br>
            </strong>Cerebral angiography is an invasive procedure that involves the use of contrast dye to provide a series of pictures of the blood vessels in the head and neck with access through the groin. It is the gold standard to determine the exact location, size and shape of the aneurysm. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>CT Angiography (CTA) <br>
            </strong>This is a non-invasive method whereby a contrast dye is injected into the arm vein with CT scanning to produce detailed images of blood flow in the brain arteries. Although the gold-standard for detecting a brain aneurysm remains cerebral angiography, CTA is frequently performed as it is less invasive. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and MR Angiography (MRA) <br>
            </strong>MRI is another imaging technology to view the brain by using a strong magnetic field. It is able to provide a more detailed image of the brain than CT. MRA utilizes MR technology to produce imaging of blood vessels of the brain. Both MRI and MRA take a longer time to perform compared to a CT scan. <br>
            <br>
            Cerebrospinal Fluid Analysis may be ordered if a ruptured brain aneurysm is highly suspected despite a normal CT brain. Following application of a local anesthetic, a small amount of brain fluid is removed from the back by a spinal needle. The fluid is tested for presence of blood. </p>
