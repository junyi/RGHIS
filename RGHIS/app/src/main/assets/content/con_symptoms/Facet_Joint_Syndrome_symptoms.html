            <p style="text-align:justify">Activities that cause pressure on the facet joints will make the neck or back pain worse. These activities include leaning backwards and &quot;extending&quot; the neck or lower back as well as twisting at the waist.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">Pain arising from the facet joints is usually at the level of the affected facet joint. Occasionally the pain may radiate to other areas. If the lower back facets are diseased, pain may radiate to buttocks or thighs. If the neck facets are involved pain may radiate to head, upper back and shoulders.</p>

            <p><strong><em>What causes Facet Joint Syndrome?</em></strong> </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">The facet joints may be diseased from injury, repetitive movements or degeneration due to age and activity. If the intervertebral disc between each vertebra is damaged, the cushioning effect of the disc is lost. This may cause more stress on the facet joints at that level. Degeneration of the facet joints may then proceed. </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">How we use our body can result in problems with the facet joints. Overweight, poor posture, bending from the back, improper lifting, poor rest positions, and prolonged sitting in poorly designed chairs can all cause stress on the facet joints.</p>
