            <p>When the pain and tenderness becomes frequent, and recurs despite adequate rest and analgesics, you should seek medical advice. <br>
            <br>
            Diagnosis of this condition is essentially made on clinical signs and symptoms. X-rays are done more to evaluate the bone surrounding the muscles and to exclude other potential causes of pain. It may also reveal calcification or the development of bone spurs of the lateral epicondylar region in chronic cases.</p>
