            <p><strong>Symptoms and Signs of Pancreas Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            The symptoms of pancreatic cancer are generally vague and non-specific. Weight loss is one of the earliest symptoms. However, there are many other medical and non-medical causes of weight loss. Abdominal pain is not uncommon late in the disease. Another late symptom is jaundice, or yellowness of the whites of the eyes.</p>
