            <p>Aneurysm is usually clinically silent and diagnosed incidentally or when it ruptures. But aortic aneurysm can cause deep, diffuse chest pain, or rarely, difficulty in swallowing (compression on gallup) or hoarseness (compression of nerve) when it grows bigger. Aneurysm in the brain may cause a headache. </p>
            <p>Rupture of aneurysm of the aorta or brain is usually fatal due to severe shock caused by massive leakage of blood into the chest or abdomen and major stroke caused by haemorrhage in the brain, respectively.</p>

            <p>If large enough, aneurysm in the abdomen can be detected as a mass by examination. Otherwise, ultrasound, CT scan or MRI of the chest or abdomen is required to confirm the diagnosis. These investigations are also used to monitor the size of aneurysm over time to assess the risk of rupture and timing of surgery.</p>
