            <p><em><strong>Atopy and Asthma<br>
            <br>
            </strong></em><span class=text>Atopy is a genetic tendency to develop allergic disease. This is usually manifested in the skin by a rash (eczema or hives). Other manifestations are allergic rhinitis and asthma. </span></p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>The test for asthma involves a breathing test (known as spirometry) which may be done before and after administration of a bronchodilator to determine if there is reversible obstruction of the airways. In addition, a substance known as methacholine (known to induce airway narrowing), may be used to determine if the airways are hyperresponsive (typical of asthmatics). These tests are available in most major restructured hospitals. </p>
