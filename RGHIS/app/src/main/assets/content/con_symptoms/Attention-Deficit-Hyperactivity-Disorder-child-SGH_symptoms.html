            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Symptoms </span></h2>
            <p>The three main signs of ADHD are: unable to pay attention or concentrate, hyperactive and impulsive behaviour.</p>
            <p>As a result, children with ADHD may face many problems at the same time: </p>
            <p><strong><em>Social<br>
            </em></strong>Children with ADHD usually have poor social and problem-solving skills. They have poor relationship with their peers and do not obey commands or requests. Some can be aggressive, use rude language and even lie or steal. They may also have poor self-control and like to take high risks. </p>
            <p><strong><em>Cognitive<br>
            </em></strong>They may talk to themselves in a childish way and are unable to understand the outcome of misbehaving. </p>
            <p><strong><em>Academic<br>
            </em></strong>Children with ADHD tend to be underachievers in school and may have learning disabilities. </p>
            <p><strong><em>Emotional<br>
            </em></strong>They may show signs of depression, are easily excited, immature in handling their emotions, overly frustrated, and have unpredictable moods. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Risk Factors</span></h2>
            <p>ADHD tends to run in families. If one or both parents have ADHD, their children are more likely to have the condition. </p>
            <p>In some cases, ADHD has been diagnosed in children whose mothers smoked or drank alcohol during pregnancies or had complicated pregnancies. Babies born underweight or prematurely also appear to have a higher chance of developing ADHD as they grow up. The same is true for children who suffered head injuries or who have had been exposed to lead or other environmental toxins such as PCBs. </p>
