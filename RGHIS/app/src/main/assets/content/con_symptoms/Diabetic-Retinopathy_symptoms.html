<h2>How do I know if I have Diabetic Retinopathy?</h2>
<p>You may develop a gradual blurring of vision that can often go unnoticed. In some patients, blood vessels leak at the  of the eye, i.e. the part of the retina responsible for central vision, causing loss of vision. A special photographic process known as fundus flourescein angiography (FFA) may be recommended by your ophthalmologist to help detect early effects of diabetic retinopathy.</p>
<p>In proliferative retinopathy, you may have hazy or complete loss of sight when bleeding occurs. Although you may not experience any pain, this severe form of diabetic retinopathy requires immediate medical attention.<br>
