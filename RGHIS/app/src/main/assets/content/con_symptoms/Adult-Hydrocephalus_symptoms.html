            <p><strong>What are the different types of hydrocephalus and symptoms? </strong></p>
            Hydrocephalus may be communicating or non-communicating. Communicating hydrocephalus occurs when the absorption of cSF is affected with no mechanical obstruction to the cSF passage. this form is called communicating because the cSF can still flow through the ventricles, which remain open in communication. non- communicating hydrocephalus, also known as 'obstructive' hydrocephalus, occurs when the flow of cSF is obstructed along one or more of the narrow pathways connecting the ventricles. <br>
            <br>
            Symptoms of hydrocephalus can be acute (rapid onset) or chronic (slow onset). As cSF accumulates in the ventricles With build up of brain pressure, symptoms such as drowsiness, headache, blurred/double vision, nausea and vomiting may occur. another condition known as normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (nPH) presents with a combination of symptoms such as difficulty in walking, dementia-like symptoms and urinary incontinence.<br>

            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p><strong>How is Hydrocephalus diagnosed?<br>
            </strong><br>
            When a patient presents with symptoms of hydrocephalus, a thorough neurological examination is performed, followed by a ct or MRi brain scan. these imaging studies may show enlarged ventricles consistent with hydrocephalus. the scan may determine the cause of the hydrocephalus, such as a tumor or other cause obstructing the normal flow of cSF. Sometimes, the diagnosis of normal Pressure hydrocephalus can be difficult and further tests such as lumbar puncture may be required. </p>
