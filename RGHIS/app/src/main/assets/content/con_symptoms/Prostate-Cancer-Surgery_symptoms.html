            Symptoms</span></h2>
            <p>Early prostate cancer is usually asymptomatic. Symptoms of prostate cancer usually show up at later stages of the disease as the tumour grows and narrows the urethra (urine passage) and when it spreads to other organs. <br>
            <br>
            The following symptoms are nonspecific and may also be caused by benign (non-cancerous) conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. They include :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Weak or interrupted flow of urine </li>
                <li>Frequent urination (especially at night) </li>
                <li>Difficulty urinating </li>
                <li>Pain or burning during urination </li>
                <li>Blood in the urine or semen </li>
                <li>Nagging pain in the back, hips, or pelvis </li>
                <li>Painful ejaculation </li>
            </ul>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>Several abnormal parameters, including clinical fi ndings and laboratory tests, can help to diagnose prostate cancer : </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE).</strong> The doctor or nurse examines the prostate by inserting a lubricated, gloved fi nger into the rectum and feeling the prostate through the rectal wall for lumps or abnormal areas. </li>
                <li><strong>Elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) level in the blood.</strong> PSA, a substance made by the prostate may be found in increased amounts in the blood of men who have prostate cancer. PSA levels may also be high in men who have an infection, infl ammation or an enlarged noncancerous gland. </li>
                <li><strong>Transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy</strong> of the prostate showing presence of cancer cells. This is a procedure in which an ultrasound probe about the size of a finger is inserted into the rectum to check the prostate. The probe is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues and make echoes. Cells are removed by a thin needle under a local anaesthetic and viewed under a microscope by a pathologist. </li>
                <li><strong>CT scan or MRI of the pelvis.</strong> This is a detailed scan of the pelvis that helps to identify the extent of cancer involvement after biopsy confirmation of cancer. </li>
            </ul>
