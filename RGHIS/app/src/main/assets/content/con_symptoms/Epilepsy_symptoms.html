            <br>
            <strong>Types of seizure strong </strong><br>
            <br>
            There are 2 main types of seizures: <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Focal Seizures</strong><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Affect one part of the body </li>
                <li>Sensory, motor or visual disturbances </li>
                <li>Patient may remain conscious throughout </li>
                <li>Can also lead to loss of consciousness </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Generalised Seizures<br>
            </strong>
            <ul>
                <li>May start as a focal seizure and spread throughout the whole brain </li>
                <li>Loss of consciousness usually between 30 seconds to 5 minutes </li>
                <li>General muscle contraction </li>
                <li>Violent rhythmic muscle relaxation and contraction lasting 1 to 2 minutes </li>
                <li>Can cause tongue biting, incontinence and difficulty in breathing </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Triggers of Seizures <br>
            </strong><br>
            The following conditions can trigger a seizure:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Forgetting to take medication </li>
                <li>Stress </li>
                <li>Lack of sleep </li>
                <li>Menstruation </li>
                <li>Concurrent Infection like flu or fever </li>
            </ul>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <br>
            Epilepsy is diagnosed based on the information of events that happened during the attack, obtained from the patient and/or observers of the events. The doctor may also order a few investigations: <br>
            <br>
            <strong>1. Electroencephalogram (EEG) <br>
            </strong><br>
            This test is done to record the electrical activity of the brain and takes about 45 minutes to 1 hour. During the test, many electrodes are attached to the patients head. The patient will also be asked to perform a few tasks to see if these activities activate epileptic seizures.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>2. Brain Scans </strong><br>
            <br>
            <strong>Computerised Tomography (CT Scan) <br>
            </strong>This scan uses computerised X-ray technology to produce pictures of the brain and may reveal structural causes of seizures.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) </strong><br>
            This is scanning of the brain using a strong magnetic field, instead of X-rays. It is more sensitive in picking up subtle structural abnormality that could be the cause of epilepsy. People who had operations with metal implants inserted are not suitable for this test because of the strong magnetic field.</div>
