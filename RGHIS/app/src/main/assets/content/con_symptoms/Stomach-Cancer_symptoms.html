            <p><strong>Symptoms and Signs of Stomach Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            Most people present with non-specific complaints, such as abdominal discomfort or indigestion. Occasionally, because the cancer forms a mass in the stomach it can block the passage of food ingested. There may be vomiting subsequently. Patients may also present with symptoms of anaemia because of blood loss from the cancer.</p>

            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Diagnostic Tests</strong><br>
            <br>
            Routine blood tests showing anaemia or a lack of red blood cells would raise the suspicion of the doctor. Another sinister finding would be the presence of blood in the faeces.</p>
            <p>Barium meal x-ray examination is able to detect stomach cancer. During this examination, the patient swallows liquid containing barium. X-rays are then taken to delineate the outline of the stomach wall. Ulcers and lumps can be detected. Endoscopy or the passage of a fiber-optic scope into the stomach through the mouth is then required so that a biopsy can be taken. Although uncomfortable, this procedure lasts only about 10 to 20 minutes. It is done as an outpatient procedure under light anaesthesia. A biopsy or removal of small amount of tissue, which is then examined under a microscope, will show if the ulcer or lump is cancerous or non-cancerous. Endoscopy is generally more accurate than a barium meal x-ray examination.</p>
            <p>Once stomach cancer is diagnosed, chest x-rays and CT scans of the abdomen are required to see if the cancer has spread elsewhere. </p>
