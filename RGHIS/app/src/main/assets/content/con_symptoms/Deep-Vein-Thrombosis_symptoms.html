            <p>Only about half of the people with deep vein thrombosis have symptoms. The symptoms may include:<br>
            - Swelling of the leg<br>
            - Pain or tenderness in the leg, usually in one leg and may be felt only when standing or walking<br>
            - Increased warmth in the area of the leg that is swollen or in pain <br>
            - Changes in skin colour or redness<br>
            <br>
            It is important to see a doctor right away if you have symptoms of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Deep vein thrombosis can cause very serious complications if not treated.</p>
