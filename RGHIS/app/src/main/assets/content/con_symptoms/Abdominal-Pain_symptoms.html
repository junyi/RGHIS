            <p><strong><em>Characteristics of Pain from Various Causes</em></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Functional Disorders<br>
            </strong>Upper abdominal discomfort after meals, often associated with a sensation of fullness, belching, nausea, early satiety or inability to finish a meal are typical features of functional disease, also known as non-ulcer dyspepsia.</p>
            <p>Irritable bowel syndrome (see related articles on this website) is due to spasm of the intestine and gives rise to upper or lower generalised abdominal pain. There is usually associated constipation and/or diarrhoea, and defecation may relieve the pain. Pain severity vary from mild to excruciating. Patients often report that pain exacerbations are precipitated by stressful life situation.</p>
            <p><strong>Structural disorders</strong> <br>
            Peptic ulcer disease (see related articles on this website) usually gives rise to upper abdominal pains worse on hunger, relieved by food and sometimes waking the patient up at night. <strong>Stomach cancer</strong> can give rise to similar pains but usually of shorter duration and associated with loss of appetite and weight. Gallbladder stones (see related articles on this website) give rise to very severe upper abdominal pain lasting up to several hours, sometimes going to the back or right shoulder. There may also be darkening of the skin and eyes (jaundice) or of the urine.Renal colic is due to a stone passing down from the kidneys. It results in excruciating pain lasting up to hours, usually in one loin but often going into the lower abdomen and groin on the same side. The urine may turn dark due to the presence of blood.<br>
            <br>
            A gynecological problem is suspected in a female with lower abdominal pain if there is associated abnormality of the periods or if the pain tends to occur at a particular phase of the menstrual cycle.</p>
            <p><strong>The acute abdomen<br>
            </strong>The pain of acute appendicitis is often generalised initially but becomes concentrated in the right lower abdomen. This pain is constant and becomes increasingly severe. It may get worse on touching the abdomen, on movement or even on breathing or coughing. There may be vomiting and fever. The pain from perforated ulcer is similar in character but occurs in the upper abdomen.</p>
            <p>In intestinal obstruction, there is generalised abdominal pain which comes in waves (colic). The abdomen becomes distended and vomiting occurs. Stools and flatus are not passed.</p>
