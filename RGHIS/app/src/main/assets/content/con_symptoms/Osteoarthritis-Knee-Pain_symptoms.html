Symptoms</span></h2>
            <p>In OA, you will have no problem in the morning on arising but as the day progresses your discomfort will increase. <br>
            <br>
            In the evening, there will be a dull ache in the area of the affected joint. <br>
            <br>
            Other symptoms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pain </li>
                <li>Swelling of the affected joints </li>
                <li>Changes in surrounding joints </li>
                <li>Warmth - The arthritic joint may feel warm to the touch </li>
                <li>Crepitation - A sensation of grating or grinding in the affected joint caused by the rubbing of damaged cartilage surfaces </li>
                <li>Cysts - In OA of the hand, small cysts may develop, which may cause the ridging or dents in the nail plate of the affected finger </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The changes associated with degenerative arthritis tend to involve similar joints. Whereas in post-traumatic degenerative arthritis where there is a history of acute or chronic trauma, the changes tend to be isolated to the specific joints injured.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
Risk Factors</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Old age</strong><br>
            As a person grows older, it becomes more likely that the cartilage may be worn away. OA is uncommon in people below 40 years of age.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Gender<br>
            </strong>Women are more likely to suffer from OA, especially after menopause.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Previous joint injury<br>
            </strong>Someone with a previous injury to the cartilage within the joint, e.g. after a fracture involving the joint or after a sporting injury to the joint will have a higher risk of developing OA later in life.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Weight<br>
            </strong>A greater than normal body weight puts more stress on the weight-bearing joints such as the hip and knee, increasing the likelihood of developing OA in these joints.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Bone deformities<br>
            </strong>People born with deformed joints or abnormal cartilage have an increased risk of OA.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Other diseases that affect the joints</strong><br>
            Bone and joint diseases that increase the risk of OA include other arthritic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Genetics</strong><br>
            Genetic factors may predispose to the development of OA.</p>
