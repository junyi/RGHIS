            <p>Symptoms like belching, fullness after meals, vague &quot;indigestion&quot; are not typical gallstone symptoms. It is important to identify clearly the patient's symptoms because operations to remove the gallbladder may not result in a cure if the symptoms are not due to stone. Typical biliary colic due to gallstones is a persistent severe pain in the upper abdomen, occurring usually after a meal and lasting several hours. Fever occurs when there is cholecystitis, or cholangitis.</p>
            <p>Other conditions may mimic gallstone disease and include peptic ulcer disease, liver disease, irritable bowel syndrome and the occasional heart attack.</p>
