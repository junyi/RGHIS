<h2>Types Of Sensory Defensiveness</h2>
<p>Each child with sensory defensiveness develops his own set of behaviours. These are usually a combination of sensory avoidance and sensory seeking behaviours. There may be defensiveness to one or many types of sensations. Although it is not possible to list all the symptoms of sensory defensiveness, the following is a list of common symptoms that can be attributed to each of the sensory systems.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tactile Defensiveness:</strong> Children with tactile defensiveness avoid letting people touch them and would rather touch others instead. They frequently fuss or resist hair washing or cutting. They may scream or throw a tantrum during baths/showers or when having their clothes changed. They often do not like to get their hands or feet dirty. Some may bump or crash into things on purpose as a way of seeking sensations that make themselves feel better. Others appear under-responsive to touch or pain. </li>
    <li><strong>Oral Defensiveness:</strong> Some children dislike or avoid certain textures or types of food. They may be over -sensitive to food of different temperatures or taste, avoid putting objects in their mouths and / or intensely dislike brushing their teeth. </li>
    <li><strong>Gravitational Insecurity:</strong> This appears to be an irrational fear of change in position or movement. These children are often fearful of having their feet leave the ground, or head tipped backwards e.g. when sitting on swings or when attempting climbing frames at the playground. This is often fear and avoidance of movement activities like jumping, hopping or climbing up and down stairs. </li>
    <li><strong>Visual Defensiveness:</strong> This may involve over-sensitivity to light and visual distractibility. They may startle more easily or avert their eyes and avoid eye contact with others. </li>
    <li><strong>Auditory Defensiveness:</strong> This reflects an over-sensitivity to certain sounds and fearful responses to noises like vacuum cleaners, motors, fire-alarms etc. Children sometimes make excessive amounts of noise to block out sound. </li>
    <li class=last><strong>Others:</strong> Other symptoms can include unusual sensitivities to smell. </li>
</ul>
