However, if the blood sugar is not very high, you may require 2 separate blood tests on different days. Sometimes an oral glucose tolerance test is required. For this test, you will be required to see your doctor in the morning after fasting for at least 8 hours. This means that you should not eat or drink anything except water the night before the test. You should have been eating a normal diet for 3 days prior to the blood test and not exercise heavily the day before the test. Your doctor will give you a very sweet drink containing glucose and will take blood from you after 1 and 2 hours to decide if you have diabetes mellitus.</td>

            <p><span style="color:#ff6600"><strong>Acute Complications</strong></span></p>
            <p>Acute complications of diabetes include those in which the blood sugar is high (hyperglycaemia) and those in which the blood sugar is low (hypoglycaemia)</p>
            <p>Hypoglycaemia is covered in another section so we will only cover hyperglycaemic diabetic emergencies in this section. These include diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma.<br>
            <br>
            Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs when there is insufficient insulin to deal with the amount of sugar in the blood stream. When this occurs, the body uses fat as an energy source and this results in the production of ketones that accumulate in the body. These ketones also appear in the urine and can be detected with a simple urine labstix test.</p>
            <p>Diabetic ketoacidosis often occurs in type 1 diabetes mellitus when the patient does not give him/herself insulin injections. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, it usually occurs when a patient has some other illness at the same time. This would include all types of infections or fever such as urine infection or chest infections. Other types of stressful events can also lead to diabetic ketoacidosis such as a heart attack.</p>
            <p><strong>Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis</strong></p>
            <p>The symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include thirst, passing large volumes of urine, feeling very tired, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Others may notice very deep, rapid breathing and a fruity smell on the breath. In severe cases, patients can become drowsy and become unconscious. This is an emergency and you must be seen immediately in a hospital.</p>
            <p>You can prevent diabetic ketoacidosis by taking your insulin and medication regularly, especially when you are sick. When you are unwell, you should monitor your blood sugar frequently and give additional insulin when the blood sugar is high. Your doctor or diabetes nurse educator should be able to give you some advice on how to make these adjustments. If you are unable to eat, you should see your doctor as you may need to be put on a drip until you recover from your illness.</p>
            <p>Compared to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can occur very quickly, hyperosmolar non ketotic coma occurs more gradually. You may feel thirst and pass large volumes of urine. This will result in your becoming more and more dehydrated. You will feel tired and may lose weight. Usually the urine ketones are negative or present only in small quantities. Patients may become more and more drowsy and become unconcious. This condition is more common in type 2 diabetes mellitus and may occur because of insufficient medication. More commonly, it occurs due to some other illness or injury such as infection. Once again, if the blood sugar is very high and you feel very unwell, it is important to consult you doctor quickly as this is also a diabetic emergency.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Chronic Complications</span></h2>
            <p>Apart from the acute diabetic emergencies, high blood sugar does not cause death or disabilty in itself. Most of the disability from diabetes mellitus results from the chronic complications of diabetes mellitus and we stress again, these are preventable.</p>
            <p>The complications of diabetes mellitus affect many organs in the body and these include the eyes, heart, feet, kidneys, and the nervous system.<br>

            <strong>Eye disease in diabetes mellitus<br>
            </strong>Diabetes mellitus can affect the eye in many ways. Cataracts and glaucoma are more common in patients with diabetes mellitus. In addition, it can affect the part of the eye at the back which is responsible for sensing light and colour, the retina. In the retina, small vessels become &quot;leaky&quot; resulting in the formation of exudates, which are the yellow areas seen in the picture below. If these exudates are too close to the most sensitive area of the retina, the macula, this can impair your vision.</p>
            <p>Diabetes mellitus also causes weakness in the blood vessel walls causing them to bulge and form microaneurysms. Generally, all persons with diabetes mellitus develop some of these microaneurysms or exudates if they have diabetes for a sufficient length of time. Unless the exudates are very close to the macula, they and the microaneuryms are harmless and will not impair your vision. We call this &quot;background retinopathy.&quot; In fact, almost all persons who have diabetes mellitus for 20 years have changes that are due to background retinopathy.</p>
            <p>Patients who have diabetes mellitus can also develop &quot;proliferative retinopathy&quot;. In these cases, new blood vessels grow on the retina. These new blood vessels are fragile and can bleed giving rise to haemorrhage in the eye and this can lead to blindness. </p>
            <p>It is important to pick up the changes due to maculopathy and proliferative retinopathy early as laser therapy can reduce the likelihood of loss of vision. In order to make sure that this is carried out at the right time, you need to go for regular eye screening. It is recommended that you have your eyes screened when you first find out you have type 2 diabetes mellitus. If they are normal, you should continue to have screening once a year. If there are any abnormalities that require attention, your doctor will refer you to an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) for treatment. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus do not require eye screening until 3 years after the diagnosis has been made and then once a year thereafter.</p>
            <p>Screening can take 2 forms. Many centres can carry out fundal photography where a photograph is taken of the back of you eye allowing a doctor to look for any changes on the retina. The photograph will serve as a permanent record. In Singapore, the polyclinics have this service available. Contact your nearest polyclinic to find out when they have this service available as there are 2 cameras that move to various polyclinics at various times of the year. When a fundal camera is not available, your doctor can look at the retina directly using an instrument called an ophthalmoscope. Most doctors who manage diabetes will have an ophthalmoscope that can be used to examine the eyes carefully. Remember that your doctor has many patients to look after and make it a point to remind him or her of the time to examine your eyes.</p>
            <p>Diabetic eye disease is one of the reasons we must try to keep the blood sugar under strict control, the DCCT has shown us that good control of blood sugar results in less eye disease and even if you already have eye disease, it can prevent it from getting worse.</p>
            <p><strong>Diabetes mellitus and the heart</strong><br>
            Coronary artery disease or blockage of the arteries supplying the heart is the major cause of death in patients with diabetes mellitus. It can result in heart attacks, heart failure or angina. The risk of developing coronary artery disease in diabetic patients is known to be several times higher at every level of cholesterol. The multiple risk factor intervention trial (MRFIT) found that coronary artery disease risk in diabetic subjects at any given plasma cholesterol level was approximately four times greater than in non-diabetic patients. This is especially true in women who lose their &quot;natural&quot; protection against heart disease. </p>
            <p>With respect to heart disease, diabetes mellitus is more than just a problem of high blood sugar. In contrast to eye and kidney disease, good blood sugar control alone is not enough to prevent the development of heart disease. Diabetes mellitus is associated with widespread abnormalities in the blood. Of particular importance to heart disease are the blood lipids, which includes cholesterol and triglyceride. High triglyceride and low HDL cholesterol (the good cholesterol) is often seen in diabetic patients. In addition, the LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) in diabetics may be 10-15% higher than in non-diabetics.</p>
            <p><strong>Are diabetics with coronary heart disease at greater risk from morbidity and mortality?</strong><br>
            In addition to the high risk of developing coronary artery disease, studies suggest that when diabetics develop blockage in the arteries supplying the heart, this is more extensive than in non-diabetic individuals. An acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in patients with diabetes mellitus is associated with some special features. The risk of death following a heart attack is higher in diabetic individuals. The long term prognosis of survivors of heart attacks amongst diabetics is also less favourable than in non-diabetics. Further, patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are more likely to have painless or unrecognised heart attack..</p>
            <p><strong>Can we prevent heart disease in diabetic patients?<br>
            </strong>Yes! Patients with diabetes mellitus should never smoke.</p>
            <p><strong>What about cholesterol lowering?</strong><br>
            We cannot answer this question directly from the available scientific evidence at this time. There is good evidence from studies conducted in Australia and New Zealand, Norway and the United States of America, that lowering blood cholesterol levels will lower the risk of heart disease in patients with diabetes mellitus. Given the very high risk of heart disease in patients with diabetes mellitus, most doctors would agree that it is important to maintain low levels of blood cholesterol. When this cannot be achieved through changes in the diet and with exercise, it may become necessary to use drugs to lower the lipid levels. We await the results of several new studies designed specifically to answer this question in diabetics and we hope to keep you posted regarding the results. We can start to expect the results of these large studies around the year 2000.</p>
            <p><strong>Kidney disease in diabetes mellitus<br>
            </strong>30-50% of patients with diabetes mellitus may develop kidney disease. Diabetes mellitus is now the more common cause of kidney failure requiring dialysis in Singapore. Kidney disease can be prevented.</p>
            <p>Kidney disease in diabetes mellitus usually follows a set pattern. It begins with the appearance of small amounts of a protein called albumin in the urine. This is called microalbuminuria and can be detected using specialised tests. It is important to screen for this stage of diabetic kidney disease because aggressive treatment can normalise the kidney function at this time. Speak to your doctor about a test for urine microalbumin. As with eye disease, this stage of kidney disease produces no symptoms and you will not know you have it unless you test for it. This should be done at the time of diagnosis for type 2 diabetes mellitus and yearly thereafter. Those with type 1 diabetes mellitus can wait 3 years before doing their first test.</p>
            <p>Later on, the amount of protein increases and patients reach a stage called nephrotic syndrome. This stage may be associated with swelling of the ankles or abdomen. As the disease progresses, the patient can eventually develop kidney failure. These later stages of kidney disease are not reversible, ie. Your kidneys cannot return to normal. However, treatment at this time can still slow down the progression of kidney disease. This is important as it will delay your requirement for dialysis, sometimes as much as 5-10 years.</p>
