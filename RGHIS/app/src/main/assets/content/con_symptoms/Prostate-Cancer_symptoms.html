            <p><strong>Symptoms and Signs of Prostate Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            Early prostate cancer is usually without symptoms and may be picked up incidentally during a routine examination of the rectum. With more advanced disease there may be difficulty passing urine. The cancer can spread to any organ or tissue in the body with the most common site of spread being the bone. As such a common symptom is bone pain.</p>
