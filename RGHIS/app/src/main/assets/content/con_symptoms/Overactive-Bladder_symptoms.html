<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>The typical clinical presentation includes urgency and/or urge incontinence, frequency and nocturia, with urgency being the commonest symptom. Any one or a combination of these symptoms can occur. The less common is the symptom of bed wetting (nocturnal enuresis). Abdominal pain and pain during urination (dysuria) are not common symptoms of OAB.</p>
<h2>Physical Examination</h2>
<p>General physical and neurological examinations should be performed. It is unusual, however, for a neurological examination to reveal unsuspected neurological dysfunction.</p>
<h2>Investigations</h2>
<p>An initial evaluation should include an assessment of the patient's symptoms, detailed physical examination and urinalysis.</p>
<p>Once urinary tract infection has been excluded, it is possible to establish a working diagnosis based on the patient's description of symptoms. In cases where there is uncertainty regarding the diagnosis, more advanced investigations should be carried out.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Urine cytology -- To detect bladder tumour </li>
    <li>Frequency Volume Chart -- A chart of the timing and volume of output to indicate the severity of the problem. Follow-up charts are also useful to provide evidence of a response to treatment </li>
    <li>Filling and Voiding Cystometry -- Cystometry is the mainstay of investigation and is the only method of objective assessment of overactive bladder </li>
    <li>Ambulatory Urodynamics -- Only for patients in whom a routine cystometry in a laboratory setting cannot elicit detrusor contractions </li>
    <li class=last>Cystoscopy -- To look for bladder stone, tumour or inflammation </li>
</ul>
