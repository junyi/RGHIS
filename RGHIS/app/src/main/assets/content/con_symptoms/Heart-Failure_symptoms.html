            <p>A person with heart failure may experience the following:<br>
            - shortness of breath<br>
            - frequent coughing, especially when lying down<br>
            - swollen feet, ankles, and legs<br>
            - abdominal swelling and pain<br>
            - fatigue<br>
            - dizziness or fainting<br>
            - sudden death</p>
            <p>A person with heart failure may have shortness of breath and coughing caused by the fluid build-up in the lungs. Pulmonary oedema may cause the person to cough up bubbly phlegm that contains blood. Other symptoms of heart failure include fluid build-up in the veins and body tissues causing swelling of the feet, legs and abdomen. When body tissues, such as organs and muscles, do not receive enough oxygen and nutrients, they cannot function well, leading to tiredness and dizziness.</p>

            <p>Diagnosis of heart failure is based on:<br>
            - symptoms<br>
            - medical history<br>
            - physical examination<br>
            - chest radiograph<br>
            -  (<strong>ECG</strong>; also called EKG)<br>
            - other imaging tests<br>
            -  </p>
            <p>Symptoms can provide important clues to the presence of <strong>heart failure</strong>.</p>
            <p>Shortness of breath while engaging in activities and episodes of shortness of breath during sleep are classic symptoms of heart failure.</p>
            <p>During the physical examination, the physician listens to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope for tell-tale signs of heart failure such as irregular heart sounds, 'gallops,' a rapid heart rate, and murmurs of the heart valves. If there is fluid in the lungs, crackling sounds may be heard. Rapid breathing or other changes in breathing may also be present. Patients with heart failure may also have a rapid pulse. </p>
            <p>By pressing on the abdomen, the physician can feel if the liver is enlarged. The skin of the fingers and toes may have a bluish tint and feel cool if not enough oxygen is reaching them. </p>
            <p>Chest radiographs can show if there is fluid in the lungs or if the heart is enlarged. Abnormalities of heart valves and other structures also may be seen on chest radiograph.</p>
            <p>An electrocardiogram gives information on the heart rhythm and the size of the heart and shows if the heart chamber is enlarged or if there is damage to the heart muscle from blocked arteries.</p>
            <p>Echocardiography can show if the heart wall or chambers are enlarged and if there are abnormalities of the heart valves. An echocardiogram can be used to find out how much blood the heart is pumping.</p>
            <p>Radionuclide ventriculography also measures the ejection fraction by imaging with very low doses of an injected radioactive substance as it travels through the heart.</p>
            <p>Cardiac catheterisation is used to measure pressure in the heart and the amount of blood pumped by the heart. This test can help find abnormalities of the coronary arteries, heart valves, heart muscle, and other blood vessels. Combined with echocardiography and other tests, cardiac catheterisation can help find the cause of heart failure. However, this is not always necessary.</p>
