            <p><strong>Symptoms and Signs of Testicular Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            Typically, patients present to their doctor with a painless lump in one or both testes. Occasionally, there may be a heavy or aching sensation in the testes. In advanced cancer, other symptoms may be present, for example, if cancer has spread to the lungs, there may be shortness of breath.</p>

            <p><strong>Diagnostic Tests</strong><br>
            <br>
            Ultrasonography of the testes will locate and delineate the size of the testicular lump. </p>
            <p>Blood tests are taken for tumour markers comprising of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). CT scan of the chest, abdomen, pelvis and occasionally, the brain, is also performed to find out the extent of cancer.</p>
            <p>Testicular cancers may be seminomas or non-seminomatous germ cell tumours, depending on what cell type is found at examination of the cancer under the microscope. An orchidectomy (removal of the testis) or biopsy is done to obtain the diagnosis.</p>
