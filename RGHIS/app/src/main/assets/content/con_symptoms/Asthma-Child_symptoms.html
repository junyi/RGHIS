<h2>Symptoms &amp; Triggers</h2>
<p>The common symptoms are wheezing, cough, shortness of breath and chest tightness.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Wheezing is a high pitched whistling sound that occurs when a child breathes out. This is caused by the air flowing through the narrowed airways. Although this is the most important symptom of asthma, it may not be present in all children. </li>
    <li>Cough is generally most troublesome at night or early in the morning. This cough can be dry and irritating. Yet others have a wet cough, and may produce whitish or yellowish phlegm. Cough may be the only complaint in a small group of asthmatic children. </li>
    <li>Shortness of breath may be severe enough to interfere with normal activity, sleep or exercise. It is usually preceded by a respiratory infection. In older children, it may occur after exercise. </li>
    <li>Chest tightness may be a complaint particularly of the older children after vigorous exercise. This may be mistaken for a heart problem. </li>
    <li class=last>Presentation of asthma varies from one child to another. While some children are predominantly troubled by wheezing, others may be bothered by a chronic cough. </li>

<h2>What Are The Common Triggers Of Asthma?</h2>
<p>Various triggers can affect the sensitive airways of children with asthma, and bring on symptoms of wheezing, cough, shortness of breath and chest tightness. However, it is often difficult to pinpoint the exact trigger. It is important to know that your child's breathing difficulties can occur hours after exposure to the trigger.</p>
<p>In practice, it is almost impossible to create an allergen-free zone, but try to keep as many allergens and irritants out of the house and bedroom as possible.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Viral Infections:</strong> Asthma is often brought on by viral respiratory infections in young children. The child starts with what seems to be a mild cold. Then 1-2 days later, he develops a cough and wheeze. The asthma symptoms can persist for 1-2 weeks. Such viral infections are unavoidable and are very common in the young child. As the child grows older and resistance to viral infection improves, asthma attacks also decrease. </li>
    <li><strong>Exercises:</strong> Most children with uncontrolled asthma develop wheeze, cough, shortness of breath or chest tightness with exercise. This is particularly so in older children who take part in more strenuous physical activities. Symptoms may occur a few minutes after exercise starts, or it may cause trouble many hours later e.g. in the night. The more intense the exercise, the more severe the attack. This is known as exercise induced asthma. Exercise induced asthma is believed to be related to the breathing in of cold, dry air which irritates the airways and hence triggers off an acute asthmatic attack. Therefore, it is commonest while exercising in cold weather or in air conditioned environment, and least likely to occur during swimming which takes place in a warm, humid environment. </li>
    <li><strong>Allergies:</strong> Asthmatic children are sensitive to certain substances called allergens, which when inhaled cause asthma. Common allergens are house dust and house dust mites (sensitivity to a protein found in the droppings of house dust mites), animals/pets (sensitivity to fur, dried saliva, proteins from urine, droppings), pollen and mould. Food allergy is uncommon but occasionally peanuts, peanut butter, citrus fruits, strawberries, egg or milk products or bird's nest may provoke asthma symptoms. </li>
    <li><strong>Irritants:</strong> Air pollution can cause breathing problems. Children with asthma have more symptoms during periods of haze. Paint can also induce asthma. Cigarette smoke is particularly bad for children with sensitive airways and should be avoided at all cost. </li>
    <li><strong>Weather Changes:</strong> Sudden changes in temperatures and humidity may worsen asthma. Cold, dry air is a trigger to the sensitive bronchial airway. Exercising in cold air may also increase the symptoms of exercise induced asthma. </li>
    <li><strong>Drug and Chemicals:</strong> Aspirin and other anti-arthritic medicines e.g. ibuprofen (Brufen), diclofenac (Voltaren) may cause asthma in some children. Certain cough mixtures, particularly those containing codeine, may sometimes worsen asthma symptoms. Children with asthma also react adversely to artificial coloring (tartrazine dye), food preservatives (metabisulfite) and monosodium glutamate (MSG). </li>
    <li class=last><strong>Emotional Factors:</strong> Emotional problems on their own do not cause asthma but anxiety, excitement and stress can aggravate the condition. Over-protective parents may create unnecessary anxieties for their children which may in turn lead to emotional and behavioural problems. Parents must discuss such problems with the doctor. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Asthma Related Allergies</h2>
<p>Some children with asthma have other related allergic conditions.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Eczema:</strong> This is particularly common in infancy. It is an itchy skin disorder affecting the cheeks, neck, creases in the elbow and behind the knees. The lesions may be red, scaly or weepy. Chronic skin lesions become thickened and darkly pigmented. </li>
    <li><strong>Allergic Rhinitis:</strong> This is the recurrent episodes of runny nose and sneezing which is particularly bad in the morning. It can be aggravated by changes in the weather, a hazy or dusty environment or when in contact with pollen or paint. It is an allergic response to an inhaled allergen, the commonest being house dust mite. In severe cases the nasal obstruction is so bad that it leads to mouth breathing and the child may snore during sleep. </li>
    <li class=last><strong>Allergic Conjunctivitis:</strong> The affected child has recurrent episodes of red, itchy and watery eyes. They tend to rub their eyes frequently. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Does Asthma Run In The Family?</h2>
<p>Careful enquiry will reveal that most asthmatic children have close relatives who have asthma or asthma related allergic conditions. However not all children with asthma have a family history.</p>

<h2>How Do Doctors Make A Diagnosis of Bronchial Asthma?</h2>
<p>Doctors usually make a diagnosis based on a detailed history and a careful examination. Special tests are usually not required, unless there are certain doubts in the diagnosis.</p>
<p>However, lung function tests are useful objective measures of the severity of the problem and for monitoring the progress after treatment. The following are the tests that may be ordered:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chest X-Ray:</strong> This may be necessary to exclude other medical conditions such as chronic chest infection or foreign body in the lung. Narrowing of the airways from other causes may be excluded. </li>
    <li><strong>Lung function tests:</strong> These tests measure airflow obstruction and therefore give an objective indication of the severity of the disease and the response to treatment. They are safe, simple and most school-going children can cope with them. </li>
    <li><strong>Peak flow rate:</strong> This is a measure of the maximum speed with which air can be forced out of the lungs. A simple instrument called a peak flow meter is used. The peak flow meter is portable and can be used easily at the clinic, even at home, in school or at work. With proper instruction, children as young as 5 years old can use peak flow meters adequately. The child is asked to breathe in deeply, then blow out as hard and as fast as possible through the meter. If the airways are blocked, the child will not be able to breathe out as fast and as hard, resulting in a lower peak flow rate. After treatment with asthma medicine, the peak flow rate improves. </li>
    <li><strong>Spirometry:</strong> It involves the child performing some breathing manoeuvres into a machine called a spirometer. It measures the volume of air that can be expelled from the lungs after full inspiration and the speed at which the air is expelled. With this test the doctor gets a detailed assessment of airflow in the smaller airways. </li>
    <li><strong>Challenge tests:</strong> In children whose history is not definitive and breathing tests are normal, &quot;stress&quot; tests may be used to induce airflow obstruction. A child is exposed to a short period of exercise or made to breathe in a chemical, following which serial measurements of peak flow rates are made. Most children with asthma will demonstrate a fall in the peak flow rates. </li>
    <li class=last><strong>Allergy tests:</strong> Allergy tests may be useful to confirm certain suspected allergens. This information may be helpful in the control of the home environment and allergen avoidance. </li>
