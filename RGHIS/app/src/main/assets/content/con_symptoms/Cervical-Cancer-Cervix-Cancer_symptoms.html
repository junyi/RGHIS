            <p><strong>Symptoms and Signs of Cervix Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            Abnormal bleeding from the vagina signals the need for an immediate examination. Abnormal bleeding includes bleeding after sexual intercourse or bleeding between menstrual periods. Late symptoms that occur when the cancer is advanced include <strong>low back pain</strong>, <strong>pelvic pain</strong>, <strong>weight loss</strong> and <strong>leg swelling</strong>. </p>

            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Diagnostic Tests</strong><br>
            <br>
            Cervical cancer screening with a Pap smear should start as soon as a woman becomes sexually active. This should be performed at1-3 yearly intervals depending on the age and the number of normal PAP smears. During this examination, a scraping of cells from the surface of the cervix is obtained during vaginal examination. This is a quick, simple and painless test.</p>
            <p>If the Pap smear is abnormal, a diagnostic procedure called colposcopy (i.e. examination of the cervix with a microscope) is done. Certain chemicals may be applied onto the cervix to help pick up abnormal areas. These abnormal areas are then biopsied and examined under a microscope by the pathologist (a doctor who examines these tissues under a microscope).</p>
            <p>If cervix cancer is confirmed on biopsy, other tests will be scheduled. These include radiological tests such as a chest x-ray and CT-scan or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis to exclude any regional or distant spread of the cancer.. Examination of the pelvis under general anaesthesia is often scheduled to determine the extent of the cancer.</p>
