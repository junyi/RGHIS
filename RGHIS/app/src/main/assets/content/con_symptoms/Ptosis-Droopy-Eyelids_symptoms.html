<h2>How do I know if I have Ptosis?</h2>
<p>You may find it more and more difficult to keep your eyes open, or you may feel eye strain and eyebrow ache from the increased effort to raise the lids, or fatigue when reading. In severe cases, it may be necessary to tilt your head backward in order to see from under the eyelid. Your family and friends might also notice that you constantly have a 'tired' appearance.  </p>

<h2>What causes Ptosis?<br>
 </h2>
Ptosis may be present at birth (congenital) or appear later in life (acquired). <br>
<br>
Congenital ptosis is usually a result of maldevelopment of the levator muscle responsible for the lifting of the upper lid. <br>
<br>
There are several causes of acquired ptosis. Among them, the most common cause is the stretching of the levator muscle, due to the ageing process. This is called aponeurotic ptosis. It is also not uncommon to develop this type of ptosis after eye surgery or after contact lens wear. Other causes of ptosis include third cranial nerve palsy and neurological muscular disorders such as myasthenia and muscle dystrophies.<br>
