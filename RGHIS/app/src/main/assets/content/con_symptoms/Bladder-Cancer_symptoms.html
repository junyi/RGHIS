            <p>Symptoms and Signs of Bladder Cancer</p>
            </h2>
            <p>The most common symptom is the passing out of bloodstained urine. This is usually not painful. Blood in the urine associated with pain is usually due to infection or stone disease.</p>
            <p>Bleeding in bladder cancer is usually more severe and associated with the passing out of blood clots. Occasionally the cancer can cause blockage of the bladder and give rise to difficulty in passing urine.</p>
            <p>If there is blood in the urine, especially if a person is above 40 years old, it is important to rule out bladder cancer.</p>

            <p><strong>Diagnostic Tests</strong> <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size:13px">If bladder cancer is suspected, the doctor will arrange for a cystoscopy, an examination where a flexible fiber-optic tube with a light source is used to look at the urethra and the bladder. This can be done under local or general anaesthetic. Removal of a small amount of tissue from the lining of the bladder can be done. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:13px">Scans of the pelvis and abdomen may be arranged to look at the other areas that may be affected by the cancer. A bone scan may be ordered if the bones are suspected to be affected by the cancer. </span></p></div>
