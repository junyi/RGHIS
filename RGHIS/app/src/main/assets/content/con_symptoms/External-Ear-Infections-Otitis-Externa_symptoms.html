            <ul>
                <li>An itchy and/or painful ear with foul-smelling fluid discharge from the ear. </li>
                <li>Hearing is often affected and you may complain of your ears being blocked. </li>
                <li>The skin of the external ear will be red and swollen and extremely sensitive to touch. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Prevention</span></h2>
            <p>The ear has a self-cleansing mechanism and clearing of wax with cotton-tips or any tools is unnecessary. Ear wax also has anti-bacteria properties that help to prevent ear infection. <br>
            <br>
            If you swim regularly, it is important to make sure the ears are dried after a swim. Turning the head and gently pulling the ear in different directions helps to drain the water out of the ear. <br>
            <br>
            Gentle use of cotton-tips may be necessary but it is not advisable to vigorously clean the ear. Ear plugs can be used to prevent water from getting into the external ear canal. <br>
            <br>
            You can also prevent water from entering the ear canal in the shower by plugging the outside ear with a piece of cotton wool that is slightly soaked with baby oil. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>Otitis externa can be diagnosed from history and/or a physical exam. Cultures of the fluid or swabs of the ear may be necessary to identify the specific bacteria and the antibiotics that are active against it. <br>
            <br>
            Occasionally, when the offending agent is a fungus, the infection is called Otomycosis. Spores and hyphae (an element of fungus) can be seen in the external ear canal.</p>
