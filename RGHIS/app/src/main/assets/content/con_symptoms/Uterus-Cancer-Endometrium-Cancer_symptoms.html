            <p><strong>Symptoms and Signs of Endometrium Cancer</strong><br>
            <br>
            The main clinical sign is abnormal vaginal bleeding (e.g. post menopausal bleeding, irregular menstrual bleeding, menorrhagia) or vaginal discharge and occasionally pelvic pain.</p>

            <p><strong>Diagnostic Tests</strong><br>
            <br>
            Ultrasound of the pelvis is useful to demonstrate whether there is any abnormality of the endometrium (e.g. thickening). However, to diagnose endometrial cancer, an endometrial biopsy is necessary. This can be achieved via outpatient aspiration of endometrial contents (e.g. pipelle or explora endometrial sampling devices) or as a minor day surgical procedure called hysteroscopy, dilatation and curettage. Specimens from the dilatation and curettage/outpatient aspiration are sent for analysis in the pathology laboratory.</p>
