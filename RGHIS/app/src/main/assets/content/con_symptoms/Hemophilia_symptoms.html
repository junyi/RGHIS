            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes</span></h2>
            <p>The underlying pathology is a sex linked disorder ie the abnormal factor 8 or 9 gene carried on the X chromosome will transmit the disease. Since each male has only one copy of X chromosome from his mother, he will be affected if his X chromosome is abnormal. Unlike the male, each female has two copies of X-chromosomes (one from father and the other from mother) and though she will not be affected when one copy is abnormal, she will be a carrier and can pass down the gene to her children. However, there are very rare situations where both her copies are abnormal e.g. when the mother is a carrier and the father is a hemophilia, or when there is a spontaneous mutation in the genes then a female hemophilia can occur. Thus in practice, almost all the hemophilia patients are male. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Diagnosis </span></h2>
            <p>Clinically, hemophilia often present with deep bleeding (eg. intramuscular bleeding, joint bleeding) and diagnosis of adult hemophilia can be ascertained by measuring factor 8 or 9 in the blood. Furthermore, genetic study on chorionic villous tissue in early pregnancy can also be performed for intrauterine diagnosis. Similar genetic study can also be used to screen the relatives for a complete family history. </p>
