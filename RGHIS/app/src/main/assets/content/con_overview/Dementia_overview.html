            <p><strong>What is dementia? </strong></p>
            <p>Dementia is the medical term used to describe a group of symptoms consisting of memory loss, impaired judgement, disorientation and behavioural changes, which are of sufficient severity to cause loss of function. <br>
            <br>
            Dementia is not part of normal ageing, although the elderly are more susceptible to becoming demented. Dementia occurs because there is degeneration of brain function, which eventually affects social or occupational activities (e.g. work, hobbies, shopping, cooking, dressing, eating, bathing and toileting). </p>

            Causes </span></h2>
            <p><strong>Causes of dementia</strong></p>
            -<strong> Alzheimers Disease (AD) <br>
            </strong>AD is the most common form of dementia. Changes in the brain occur gradually, and symptoms include short term memory problems, changes in judgment or reasoning and the inability to perform familiar tasks. <br>
            <br>
            - <strong>Vascular Dementia (VaD) (Strokes causing dementia)</strong> <br>
            VaD may be preventable, therefore early detection and diagnosis is important. Lack of circulation of blood through the brain causes damage to localised areas frequently associated with muscle weakness. This can cause changes in thinking and behaviour. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>- FrontoTemporal Dementia (FTD)</strong> <br>
            In the early stages, FTD primarily affects personality, behaviour and/or speech. Persons with FTD may behave impulsively and be difficult to redirect. Memory and orientation remain relatively intact. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>- Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) <br>
            </strong>LBD is a form of progressive dementia with noticeable fluctuations from day to day in attention and ability to function. Persons may report what sounds to be a vivid imagination/hallucinations. Features can also resemble Parkinsons Disease (rigidity, tremors, stooped posture). <br>
            <br>
            <strong>- Parkinsons Disease with dementia <br>
            - Autoimmune diseases of the brain <br>
            - Normal pressure hydrocephalus <br>
            - Brain trauma</strong>   </div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Introduction>
