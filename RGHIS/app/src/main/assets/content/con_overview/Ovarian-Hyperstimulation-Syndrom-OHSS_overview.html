<h2>What Is Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)? </h2>
<p>The medications (gonadotrophins) used to stimulate your ovaries during in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) or associated procedures for fertility treatment are designed to ensure that a reasonable number of eggs are obtained to maximise your chances of pregnancy. OHSS happens when too many ovarian follicles have developed in response to the usual dosage of medication. It is a result of the hormones produced by the ovaries in response to the usual dosage of medication. It is a result of the hormones produced by the ovaries in response to the drugs given. </p>
<p>OHSS is usually mild and causes no more than a slight lower abdominal discomfort in most cases.</p>
<p>Although uncommon, it warrants medical attention as it can be potentially life threatening, if left untreated in severe cases.</p>
<p>When detected early and managed appropriately, the condition can be controlled.</p>
<h2>Occurrence Of OHSS </h2>
<p>Some 6% to 8% of patients undergoing IVF treatment will experience mild forms of OHSS. The severe form will affect less than 1% of patients.</p>
