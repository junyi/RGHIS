    <li>In Singapore, 880 new cases were diagnosed between 1993 and 1997. </li>
    <li>There has been a steady increase over time with an almost doubling in rate over the last 20 years. </li>
    <li>By the time the symptoms develop, the disease is often incurable. </li>
    <li>Women who have an immediate family member with ovarian cancer have a 3 - 10% risk of developing the disease. </li>
    <li>For women with 2 or more immediate family members with ovarian cancer, the risk may go as high as 50%. </li>
    <li>Although currently, there is no proven method for the early detection of ovarian cancer, the tests we are using have shown the most promise. </li>
