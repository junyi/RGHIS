<h1 class=sectionbanner>CORNEAL INFECTIONS</h2>
<p><em>Exposure to viruses, bacteria, fungi or parasites  particularly in contact lens users  can cause the<br>
eyes to become infected.</em> </p>
<h2>What is a Corneal Infection?</h2>
<p>A corneal infection is an infection of the cornea, the clear section in front of the eyeball that allows light into the eye (). Infections can be due to micro-<br>
organisms such as bacteria, fungus, parasites  acanthamoeba &amp; microsporidia, and viruses such<br>
as herpes simplex. </p>

<h2>What causes Corneal Infections?</h2>
<p>Poor contact lens hygiene is the most common cause of corneal infections in Singapore. The yearly incidence of infections related to contact lens wear varies between 1 in 10,000 hard contact lens users, 4 in 10,000 soft contact lens users to 22 in 10,000 extended wear contact lens wearers. The yearly incidence of vision loss from contact lens related infections has been estimated to be approximately 0.6 in 10,000 users in studies carried out in Australia and India. </p>
<p>Corneal infections usually occur because of exposure to bacterial, viral or microbiological agents that cause the eyes to become red and swollen. In severe cases, it can cause changes to the corneal shape leading to astigmatism, opacification of the cornea from scarring or a combination of both.</p>
<p>Apart from contact lens related infections, infections can also occur due to existing abnormalities or disturbances of the eye surface or cornea or in cases of eye injury. </p>

<h2>Can Corneal Infections be prevented?</h2>
<p>As contact lens related infections are the most common, simple measures when wearing contact lenses can help reduce the risk of infections.  These include:</p>
<p> Improving contact lens hygiene <br>
 Reducing contact lens wear time <br>
 Avoiding high risk activities<br>
 Changing the type of contact lens used</p>
<p>However, any form of contact lens wear still carries the risk of corneal infection. Avoiding contact lens wear completely in patients who have predisposing diseases of the cornea or surface of the eye may be necessary.<br>
<br>
Corneal infections after eye trauma can also be prevented in work site-related injuries with the appropriate use of safety googles. </p>
