<h2>Skin-to-Skin Contact With Your Baby</h2>
<h2>What is skin-to-skin?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Skin-to-skin means placing the naked newborn baby onto the mothers chest. </li>
    <li>The nurse dries the baby, places him onto the mothers chest and covers the babys back with a warm blanket. </li>
    <li>Both the mother and the baby should be kept in this position for at least the first hour of life, as much as possible. </li>
    <li>Routine newborn care practices for the baby can be performed while the baby is still on the mothers chest. </li>
</ul>
