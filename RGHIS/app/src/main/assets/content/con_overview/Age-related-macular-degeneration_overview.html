<h1 class=sectionbanner>AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION</h2>
<p><em>If haziness or blank spots appear in your central vision, or if you find that straight lines look a little wavy to you, see your eye doctorРІвЂќР‚it could be a sign of age-related macular degeneration, an eye condition that could lead to severe vision loss.</em></p>
<h2>What is Age-Related Macular Degeneration? </h2>
<p>It is a chronic irreversible medical condition that results in loss of vision central because of damage to the macula, or central part of the retina. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of blindness in those over 50 years old. The condition can make it difficult to read or recognise faces, although enough peripheral vision (vision outside the central area of your gaze) remains to allow you to continue with other daily activities. However, driving and reading will be affected.</p>

<h2 align=left>What causes Age-Related Macular Degeneration?</h2>
<p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) occurs in 'dry' and 'wet' forms. In dry AMDРІвЂќР‚the most common formРІвЂќР‚the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down, blurring central vision in the affected eye. The exact cause of dry AMD is unknown, but the condition develops as the eye ages. In the 'wet' form, abnormal blood vessel growth in the eye leads to the leaking of blood and proteins into the sensitive cells (called photoreceptors) in the macula, damaging them and causing vision loss. The wet form is the condition in its advanced stage.</p>

<h2>What puts me at risk of Age-Related Macular Degeneration?</h2>
<p>Your risk increases with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Age: There are no current figures on how many Singaporeans have AMD but a community study in 1997 showed that one in four people aged 60 and above here suffered from the condition </li>
    <li>A positive family history </li>
    <li>Gender: Women are more likely to develop AMD </li>
    <li>Smoking </li>
    <li>Obesity </li>
    <li>Cardiovascular diseases </li>
</ul>

<h2>What can I do to prevent Age-Related Macular Degeneration?</h2>
<p>There are no proven preventive medications for AMD. The best way to prevent vision loss is to get a prompt eye examination and diagnosis by your eye doctor. Early diagnosis improves the success of treatment. Using a screening tool called the Amsler grid may help detect subtle changes in your vision. You can monitor your vision daily by looking at an Amsler grid. You should also stop smoking, eat a balanced diet that includes leafy green vegetables, and protect your eyes from UV light by wearing protective sunglasses or head gear with brims. </p>
