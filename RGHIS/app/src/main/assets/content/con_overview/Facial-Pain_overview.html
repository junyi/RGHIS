            <p><strong>What is Trigeminal Neuralgia (Facial Pain)?</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Trigeminal neuralgia (facial pain)</strong> is characterised by brief episodes of intense, stabbing, electric shock-like pain on the face. These episodes occur spontaneously or can be triggered by light touch, chewing, or changes in temperature (i.e. cold). The pain is so intense as to be completely disabling. In addition, weight loss is common because oral triggers prevent affected individuals from eating enough to maintain adequate nutrition. A less common form of the disorder, called 'atypical trigeminal neuralgia', may cause less intense, constant, dull burning or aching pain, sometimes with occasional electric shock-like stabs. </p>
