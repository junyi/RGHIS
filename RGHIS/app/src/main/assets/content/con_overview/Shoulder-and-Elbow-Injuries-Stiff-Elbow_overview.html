            <p>The elbow is a joint that is easily complicated by stiffness after injury or disease. This is because the elbow actually comprises 3 separate joints that fits extremely well together, and is in close proximity to a host of soft tissue structures.</p>

            <br>
            <strong>Post-injury stiffness<br>
            </strong>The most common cause in our population is post-injury stiffness of the elbow.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Other diseases</strong><br>
            A stiff elbow joint can also arise due to other diseases like infection and auto-inflammatory conditions (for example, rheumatoid arthritis).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Congenital problems</strong><br>
            Certain congenital problems may also present with elbow stiffness. </div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Introduction>

            <a class=ms-asset-internalBookmark id="Risk Factors" title="Risk Factors"></a>Risk Factors</span></h2>
            <br>
            <strong>Prolonged immobilisation<br>
            </strong>Patients with prolonged immobilisation of the elbow joint due to injury or illness are at highest risk of developing elbow stiffness.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Damage to joint</strong><br>
            Diseases like infection that lead to damage of the joint surface (also known as the articular cartilage) also predispose to elbow stiffness. </div>
