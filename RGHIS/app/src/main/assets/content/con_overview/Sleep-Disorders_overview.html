            <p><strong>What is Normal Sleep?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Normal sleep consists of cycles of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep alternating with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. NREM sleep consists of light sleep and deep sleep. REM sleep is also known as 'dream' sleep. The function of sleep is believed to be restorative, a time of rest and repair for the body. </p>
            <p>Adults need an average of 8 hours of sleep (range of 6 - 10 hours). It is normal to fall asleep within 10 to 20 minutes of going to bed, to wake up spontaneously once or twice in the night then fall back to sleep readily, and wake up feeling refreshed. Children need more sleep and tend to have more deep sleep, while the elderly have more frequent awakenings and less deep sleep.</p>
            <p><strong>What happens when we do not get enough sleep?<br>
            </strong><br>
            The serious short and long term consequences of sleep deprivation reflect the important restorative functions of sleep. When we do not get enough sleep, our thinking, memory, concentration, alertness and mood are affected. Daytime sleepiness leads to poor school or work performance and can result in serious accidents. Left untreated, long term sleep disturbances decrease quality of life and can lead to increased morbidity and mortality.</p>
            <p><strong>Sleep disorders <br>
            </strong><br>
            Sleep disorders are sleep-related disturbances due to underlying medical problems, lifestyle and environmental factors which usually cause sleep disruption, leading to insufficient or poor quality sleep.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600"><br>
            Causes </span></h2>
            <p><strong>What causes Excessive Daytime Sleepiness?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Common causes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Insufficient sleep. Many people do not get sufficient sleep because of lifestyle choices. </li>
                <li>, which refers to cessation of breathing during sleep. Patients may be obese or have blockage of their breathing passages due to problems in their nose or throat. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Uncommon but important cause:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Narcolepsy, a sleep disorder which is associated with sudden loss of muscle tone, hallucinations and muscle paralysis on waking. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>People with excessive daytime sleepiness severe enough to cause social or occupational disruption should undergo formal evaluation by a physician. Those with suspected sleep apnoea or narcolepsy usually need to undergo sleep studies. </p>
            <p><strong>What causes Insomnia? </strong><br>
            <br>
            Insomnia refers to difficulty falling or staying asleep, or a perception of unrefreshing sleep. Insomnia is often related to more than one cause, including psychological and lifestyle factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Excessive or poor managed stress </li>
                <li>Depression and anxiety </li>
                <li>Excessive caffeine consumption </li>
                <li>Poor sleep habits and irregular sleep patterns </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Patients with persistent insomnia should be evaluated by a physician to rule out underlying depression, which often presents with early morning waking. Patients who are unable to sleep without sleeping pills may need to be referred to a Sleep Disorders Clinic. Most patients with insomnia can be managed with lifestyle modifications and medication, and do not usually need a sleep study.</p>
            <p><strong>What causes Abnormal Behaviour in Sleep?<br>
            </strong><br>
            Abnormal behaviour in sleep often does not require specific treatment unless there is risk of injury, or if the abnormal movements disrupt sleep. Examples of sleep disorders associated with abnormal movements are restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder, in which excessive leg jerking before or during sleep causes insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness.</p>
            <p>The parasomnias are abnormal behaviours during sleep which can occur in children or adults:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sleep terrors </li>
                <li>Nightmares </li>
                <li>Sleep talking </li>
                <li>Teeth grinding </li>
                <li>Sleep walking </li>
                <li>Acting out dreams </li>
            </ul>
            <p>A sleep study is frequently required to evaluate these conditions. They must be distinguished from seizures occurring during sleep, which can appear very similar.</p>
