            <p><strong>What are Brain Tumours?</strong><br>
            <br>
            A brain tumour is an abnormal growth of cells inside the skull. <br>
            <br>
            Primary brain tumours are tumours which arise from the brain. They can grow from the cells of the brain, blood vessels in the brain, nerves that emerge from the brain or the membranes covering the brain. Benign (non-cancerous) brain tumours are generally slow-growing tumours. They can exert potentially damaging pressure on the brain but they do not spread into the surrounding brain tissue. Malignant (cancerous) brain tumours are rapid growing and they spread into the surrounding brain.<br>
            <br>
            Secondary or metastatic brain tumours grow from cancer cells that originate from a primary cancer located in another organ (e.g. lung, breast or colon).<br>
            <br>
            Both primary and secondary brain tumours can result in severe disability and can cause death if the growth is left unchecked. All patients with symptoms of a possible brain tumour should be evaluated by a neurosurgeon for diagnosis and treatment. </p>

            Causes </span></h2>
            <p><strong>Causes of Brain Tumours</strong></p>
            <p>A few genetically inherited diseases have been identified that can increase the risk of the development of brain tumours. For example, in the inherited condition known as Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome, children, siblings and relatives can develop tumours in the cerebellum and other parts of the body such as malignant kidney tumours. Research has shown identifiable genetic abnormalities in some brain tumours. Some tumours are also known to have an increased incidence in certain families. However, in the vast majority of cases, the cause of brain tumours is unknown. There is at present, no clear evidence that injury, chemical exposure, viral infection, mobile phone use, environmental factors or mental stress can cause the growth of brain tumours. </p>
