            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes </span></h2>
            <p><strong>Otitis externa</strong> is an infection of the lining of the ear canal (outer ear). It can occur when water in the ear irritates the lining of the ear canal, which then develops a secondary bacterial or fungal infection. </p>
            <p><strong>Otitis media</strong> is an infection of the middle ear (behind the eardrum). Young children are more prone to otitis media because the tubes (Eustachian tubes) connecting the middle ear to the throat are shorter and softer. These tubes are also more prone to becoming blocked. </p>
