            <p><strong>What is Breast Cancer?<br>
            </strong><br>
            Breast cancer is a malignant tumour. It occurs when breast cells become abnormal and divide without control or order. Normal cells divide and produce in an orderly manner. Sometimes this orderly process is disrupted and cells grow and divide out of control producing extra tissue to form a mass or lump called a tumour. A tumour can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). The breasts are made up mainly of fat cells and gland cells. Milk-producing glands in the breast are made up of individual cells which normally reproduce under the control of hormones. Sometimes this process of reproduction goes out of control and an abnormal glandular structure develops. This is the beginning of cancer. The majority of breast cancers start in the milk ducts. A small number start in the milk sacs or lobules. </p>
            <p><strong>How common is Breast Cancer?</strong><br>
            <br>
            More than 20% of all cancers diagnosed in women are breast cancers. Between 2005 and 2009, about 1490 women were diagnosed to have breast cancer in Singapore every year.</p>
            <p>Nine out of 10 women who go to their doctors with breast lumps have a benign disorder, not cancer. Normal changes associated with the menstrual cycle can make breasts feel lumpy. </p>
            <p><strong>Age of Onset</strong><br>
            <br>
            The risk of breast cancer increases with age. Most women who are diagnosed to have breast cancer are older than 40 years old, but younger women may also be affected.</p>

            Causes and Risks</span></h2>
            <p>Breast cancer is often triggered by the repeated monthly cycling of normal female hormones. The length of the fertile period, i.e. from the first period until menopause, is a risk factor. A woman whose menopause occurs at 55 years has a significantly greater risk than a woman who menopauses at 45 years. Age at first completed pregnancy is also important: having the first completed pregnancy after the age of 30 years increases the risk compared to those who complete the first pregnancy before age 30. Likewise, women who have never been pregnant also have a higher risk. Breast feeding also protects against breast cancer. Hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of breast cancer and this should be discussed before embarking on the treatment.</p>
            <p>Between 5 to 10% of all breast cancer are associated with genetic factors. The genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been identified and may be associated with breast cancer occurring in approximately half of all families with a very strong history of breast and/or ovarian cancer.</p>
