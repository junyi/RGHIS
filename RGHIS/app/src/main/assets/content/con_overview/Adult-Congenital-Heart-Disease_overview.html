            <p>An increasing number of children with congenital heart disease are surviving into adulthood due to greatly improved surgical, medical, anaesthetic and intensive care over the last few decades. The survival of congenital patients into adulthood is now close to 85% in comparison to the 15% survival several decades ago. This new group of patients is now entering adulthood and will need regular monitoring and sometimes further surgical interventions may also be required. With the exception of a few conditions, ligation of isolated patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and closure of isolated atrial and ventricular septal defects, surgical treatment of congenital heart disease is more often palliative than curative. Repeated procedures and interventions are the norms as conduits, baffles, shunts and grafts become stenosed, blocked and incompetent with time. In addition to the medical and surgical issues, this growing population may also face specific social, psychological and behavioral problems throughout their life. </p>
            <p>It is timely that Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) is gaining recognition worldwide and in Singapore as an established sub-specialty of cardiology. </p>

            <p>The incidence of congenital heart disease (CHD) in Singapore is 0.81% of total live births based on the birth defect registry from 1994-2000. In Singapore, with an estimated population of around 4.3 million, the estimated number of adults with CHD would be in the region of 12,000 adults with an extra 300-320 cases added annually, assuming an annual birth of 37,000  40,000 newborns. It is estimated that in the next decade, the number of adult patients with congenital heart disease worldwide will exceed their paediatric counterparts. </p>
