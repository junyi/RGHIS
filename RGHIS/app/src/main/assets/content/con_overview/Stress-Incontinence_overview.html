            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p>Stress incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine when there is an increase in abdominal pressure (e.g., during coughing or exercise). It is a common disorder with 20% of women suffering from stress incontinence at one time or another.</p>
            <p>The inconvenience it causes varies from woman to woman. In most cases treatment of stress incontinence is simple, however, a small number of women may require surgical treatment. </p>
            <p>Nearly all women with stress incontinence can either be cured or the degree of incontinence much improved. </p>

            <p><strong><em>The urinary system</em></strong> </p>
            <p>Urine produced in the kidneys is passed via the ureters to the bladder where it is stored until it is convenient for it to be emptied. The bladder is simply a muscular bag that expands to store up to 300-500 ml of urine. </p>
            <p>When you pass urine the bladder contracts. Most women empty their bladder 4-6 times a day passing 200-300ml of urine each time The urethra is the outlet from the bladder. It passes through the pelvic floor muscles in front of the vagina. These muscles act like a control valve around the urethra. They tighten when you cough or exercise and relax when urine is passed. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes and Risk </span></h2>
            <p>In most cases it is due to a weakness of the pelvic floor muscles and is more common in women who have delivered children but also may be due to lack of exercise or simply getting older. Weakness of the pelvic floor muscles may be associated with a prolapse of the bladder into the vagina. </p>
            <p>Leakage of urine may also be due to urge incontinence. It is due to an involuntary bladder contraction (detrusor instability) and its treatment is different from stress incontinence. There are other rare causes of incontinence, the doctor will assess you to exclude them.  </p>
