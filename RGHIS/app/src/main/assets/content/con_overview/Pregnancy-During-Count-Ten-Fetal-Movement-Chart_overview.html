<h2>What you need to do:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Beginning at 9.00am, count the number of times your baby moves. </li>
    <li>Put a tick (РІв‚¬С™ ) against the time graph whenever this occurs. For example, if your baby moves at 2.15pm, put a tick (РІв‚¬С™ ) in the square between 2.00pm and 2.30pm. </li>
    <li>At the end of the day, count the number of ticks which you have recorded on the graph and indicate the number in the box provided. </li>
</ul>
