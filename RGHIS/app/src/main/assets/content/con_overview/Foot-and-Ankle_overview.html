            <p>The foot and ankle bears the stress of our body weight as we go about our daily activities. This stress is relentless. As we walk over uneven ground, it allows us to accommodate to the undulation, further adding stress to the numerous joints in the foot. <br>
            <br>
            Fashionable footwear has further added problems as women squeeze their feet into shoes of all shapes and sizes. Sporting injuries and fractures are also very common in the foot. <br>
            <br>
            The critical thing about the foot is that an injury or abnormality in one joint, can rapidly cause additional injuries to its neighbouring joints due to the close proximity and relationships. Hence, prompt diagnosis and appropriate management is crucial to having a good outcome.</p>

            <br>
            The main causes of chronic foot pain are either degenerative or arising from a previous injury. <br>
            <br>
            Painful degenerative problems can affect the joints of the foot, or the tendons or fascia (soft tissue). Some common diagnosis will include plantar fasciitis, hallux valgus, collapsed arches in adults, osteoarthritis of the small joints or the ankle. <br>
            <br>
            Injuries of the foot and ankle can arise from sports or normal daily activities. Occult fractures can occur or the soft tissues can be damaged. The soft tissues refer to ligaments and fascia which hold the bones together, or the tendons which moves the bones. They can be stretched, torn or dislocated. </div>
