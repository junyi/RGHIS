            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP)</strong> is due to an abnormal growth of blood vessels in the baby's eye. It is most common in babies who are very premature (more than 12 weeks early. In the babys development, blood vessels grow from the back central part of the eye out towards the edges. This process is completed just a few weeks before the normal time of delivery. In premature babies, this process is not complete. If blood vessel grows normally, the baby does not develop ROP. If the vessels grow and branch abnormally, the baby has ROP. </p></div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Introduction>
            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes </span></h2>
            <p>Doctors do not fully know all the factors leading to ROP. What is clear is that the smallest and sickest babies are at highest risk of ROP.</p>
            <p>In the 1940's and 1950's, premature babies were often placed in oxygen whether or not they had lung problems or needed extra oxygen. Some of these babies developed Retrolental Fibroplasia, a condition like advanced ROP. Today, the use of oxygen is carefully monitored so babies get the right amount of oxygen into their blood, not too little or too much. In fact, enough oxygen in the blood is important for healing ROP.</p></div>
