<p><span style="line-height:18px;color:#666666">40% of Singapore preschoolers have a severe form of decay called Early Childhood Caries (ECC). <br>
If you have a young child, she/he is at risk. ECC is identified by:
<ul>
    <li>decay which first attacks a young child's front teeth, sometimes as soon as they erupt </li>
    <li>decay which is rapidly spreading and has a typical pattern of spread </li>
</ul>
<br>
<span style="font-size:10px"><em><span style="color:#999999">ECC in a 2yr old child. Decay affecting first the front teeth<br>
then spreads to other teeth. Note how lower incisors are spared.</span></em></span><em></em><br>
