            Overview</span></h2>
            <p>The number of people diagnosed with cognitive impairment have increased in the recent years. At National Neuroscience Institute (NNI), we see approximately 250 -300 new cases per year, and half of them are below 65 years old. With the increasing awareness of cognitive impairment, the number of patients with Young Onset Cognitive Impairment (YOCI) is likely to rise.</p>
            <p><strong>What Is YOCI? </strong></p>
            <p>YOCI includes mild cognitive impairment and dementia occurring in patients under the age of 65 years. </p>

            <p><strong>Causes of YOCI</strong></p>
            <p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an important cause of YOCI. MCI refers to individuals with mild cognitive impairment, who have difficulty in memory and other cognitive abilities but have normal daily functions'. </p>
            <p><strong>Causes of dementia in the young include: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Alzheimers Disease </li>
                <li>Vascular Dementia </li>
