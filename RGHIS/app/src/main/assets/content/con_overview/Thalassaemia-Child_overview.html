<h2>Thalassaemia</h2>
<h2>What Is Thalassaemia?</h2>
<p>Thalassaemia is an inherited blood disorder which is caused by an abnormal gene. A person with thalassaemia is unable to produce normal, functioning haemoglobin in the blood.</p>
<p>Haemoglobin carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. When the body is not able to produce normal, functioning haemoglobin, the affected person suffers from anaemia.</p>
<p>Thalassaemia is passed on from parent to child and can affect both males and females. In Singapore, about 3% of the population are carriers of the thalassaemia gene.</p>
<h2>What Are The Types Of Thalassaemia?</h2>
<p>There are two types of thalassaemia:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Thalassaemia minor (thalassaemia trait) </li>
    <li class=last>Thalassaemia major. </li>
</ol>
<p>A person who has inherited one thalassaemia gene is said to have thalassaemia minor (thalassaemia trait). He or she is healthy and leads a normal life. Most people with thalassaemia minor do not know that they have it. However, the affected persons can pass on the abnormal gene to their children.</p>
<p>Thalassaemia major is a severe form of anaemia. The affected person has inherited two thalassaemia genes, one from each parent. He or she may look normal at birth but within 1 - 2 years of life, will suffer from severe anaemia, which leads to poor growth and development as well as a shorter lifespan.</p>
<p>The affected person will need blood transfusion every month to sustain life. At present, a bone marrow transplant is the only hope of possible cure for thalassaemia major.</p>
<h2>How Is Thalassaemia Inherited?</h2>
<p><strong>If only one parent has thalassaemia minor</strong>, the following can occur:</p>

<ul>
    <li>- 50% chance of having a child with thalassaemia minor </li>
    <li>- 50% chance of having a normal child </li>
    <li class=last>- None of the couples children will get thalassaemia major. </li>
</ul>
<p>If both parents have thalassaemia minor, the following can occur:</p>

<ul>
    <li>- 25% chance of having a child with thalassaemia major </li>
    <li>- 50% chance of having a child with thalassaemia minor </li>
    <li>- 25% chance of having a normal child </li>
</ul>
<p>The chances are the same with each pregnancy, no matter how many children the couple may have.</p>

<h2>Who Should Go For Thalassaemia Screening?</h2>
<p>Since thalassaemia can be passed on from one generation to another, you and your partner should go for a thalassaemia screening if you are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>- Planning to get married </li>
    <li class=last>- Starting a family. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thalassaemia screening involves a simple blood test and is available at all polyclinics.</strong></p>
