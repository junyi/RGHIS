            <p><strong>What is Cervical Spondylosis? <br>
            </strong><br>
            Cervical spine is made up of bones (vertebraes) with cushions (discs) between them. as we grow older, the bones and the discs will degenerate. Bone spurs (osteophytes) may form and spinal canal may narrow (stenosis). these changes are known as cervical spondylosis. </p>
