            <p>Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the bone marrow plasma cells. It is primarily found in the elderly and current treatment may result in prolonged remissions but the disease remains generally incurable. </p>
            <p>Before proceeding to treat multiple myeloma, it is important to exclude monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (which may affect as many as 5% of the population over 70 years of age) or any similar smouldering or indolent type of myeloma which may not require immediate treatment. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Diagnosis </span></h2>
            <p>Myeloma is confirmed by the presence of increased plasma cells in the bone marrow, bony lytic lesions or a monoclonal protein band on electrophoresis. </p>
