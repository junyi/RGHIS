            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Procedure</span></h2>
            <p>There are 2 types of studies. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>For the liquid study, a very small amount of tracer is mixed in a cup of water which the patient will drink. </li>
                <li>The solid study involves a small amount of tracer mixed in an egg toast which the patient will eat. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>A Gamma camera will be placed in front of the patient, over the stomach region and the progression of the water or food will be monitored over a period of time. The entire study can be up to 1 hour. There should be minimal movement during the procedure.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Before the Examination </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You should not take any food 6 hours prior to the procedure. </li>
                <li>Diabetic patients can bring their medication and administer it prior to the procedure. </li>
                <li>You should not have undergone a stomach or small intestine examination using a scope (gastroscope) at least one week before the procedure. </li>
                <li>You should stop all stomach medications 2 days before the procedure. Please consult your doctor or nuclear medicine physician on which medications to stop. </li>
