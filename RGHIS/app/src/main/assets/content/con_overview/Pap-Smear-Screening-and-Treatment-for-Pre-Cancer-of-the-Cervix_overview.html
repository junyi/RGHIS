<h2>Pap Smear Screening and Treatment for Pre-Cancer of the Cervix</h2>
<p>Cervix cancer is the 5th commonest cancer among women in Singapore. This year, about 300 women in Singapore will develop cancer of the cervix. However it can be easily prevented by screening with the Pap smear.</p>
<p>The cervix is the lower, narrow end of the womb that opens into the vagina. Cervix cancer occurs when the cells of the cervix start to grow in an abnormal, uncontrolled way, which can then damage other healthy parts of the body. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"></p>
<p>Fortunately some early changes in the cervix can be seen long before cancer develops (Pre-Cancer changes). Treating the cervix at this Pre-Cancer stage can therefore prevent cervix cancer from ever occurring.</p>
