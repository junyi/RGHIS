<h1 class=sectionbanner>CHILDHOOD MYOPIA</h2>
<em>Does your child strain to view things? He or she could have childhood myopia, a problem that can be corrected readily and stabilised with spectacles.</em><br>

<h2>What is childhood myopia?</h2>
<p>Childhood myopia is a form of  that begins and progresses during childhood. Myopic children may complain of problems seeing distant objects such as oncoming bus-numbers, the white-board in class or television. Sometimes they may tilt or turn their head, or narrow their eyes to see better. The condition is easily corrected with spectacles. However, as myopia often increases by 1.00D every year till the children reach their teenage years, their vision needs to be checked at least once every year, as their spectacles may need to be changed.</p>

<h2>What causes childhood myopia (short-sightedness)?</h2>
<p>Evidence indicates that progressive childhood myopia is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Children whose parents are myopic are also more likely to be myopic, and children who spend more time indoors (reading, watching television and playing computer games) appear to be more at risk than those who spend more time outdoors.  </p>
