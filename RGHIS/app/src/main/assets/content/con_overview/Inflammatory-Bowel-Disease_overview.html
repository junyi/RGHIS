            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p>Two related disorders are referred to collectively as idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). They are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Crohn's disease (CD) and </li>
                <li>Ulcerative colitis (UC). </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both disorders are characterised by inflammation in the lining (mucosa) of the intestines. The mucosa becomes inflammed and breaks (ulcers) may occur on the surface. In ulcerative colitis, the inflammation is restricted to the large intestines. In Crohn's disease, any part of the GI tract may be affected : from the mouth to the anus. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Symptoms </span></h2>
            <p>Excessive amounts of mucus containing pus may be produced and the intestinal lining may bleed. Hence common symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Diarrhea </li>
                <li>bloody stools </li>
                <li>passage of mucous </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other symptoms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>fever </li>
                <li>weight loss </li>
                <li>abdominal pain </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why is it called &quot;Idiopathic&quot;?</strong></p>
            <p>While there are many theories, and tremendous progress is being made in research, the actual reason why a patient gets Idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease is still not known. Hence these 2 diseases are more accurately called Idiopathic (cause unknown) inflammatory bowel disease. </p>
