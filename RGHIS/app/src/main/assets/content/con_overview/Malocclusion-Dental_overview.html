<p><span style="color:#666666;line-height:18px">Teeth which are not aligned, or which do not fit in proper relationship between the two jaws, constitute a malocclusion.

</span></p></div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Introduction>
<strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Causes</span></strong><br>
Malocclusion can be caused by hereditary or local factors.
<ul>
    <li>tooth and jaw size discrepancy - teeth which are larger than can be fitted in the jaw will result in crowding conversely, smaller teeth in a large jaw will result in gaps between the teeth </li>
    <li>discrepancy in size or relationship of upper and lower jaw - this results in protrusion of either jaw or open or deep bites. </li>
    <li>abnormally shaped teeth </li>
    <li>oral habits such as thumb sucking or tongue thrusting </li>
    <li>cleft lip/palate </li>
    <li>as part of a syndrome </li>
</ul>

<strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Symptoms</span></strong><br>
Most of us have some imperfection in our occlusion. Minor imperfections do not impair function and it is subjective whether they impair aesthetics. However moderate to severe malocclusions can
<ul>
    <li>impair functions like chewing, and keeping the mouth closed </li>
    <li>affect facial appearance </li>
    <li>affect speech </li>
</ul>

<strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Risk factors</span></strong><br>
You may be at risk of a malocclusion if you have 
<ul>
    <li>oral habits like thumb sucking </li>
    <li>hereditary factors (see causes) </li>
    <li>early loss of milk teeth eg from extractions due to decay </li>
    <li>loss of permanent teeth which are not replaced </li>
</ul>
