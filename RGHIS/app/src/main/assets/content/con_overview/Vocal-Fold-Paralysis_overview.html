            <p>Vocal fold paralysis is less common than the first two groups of disorders. It usually involves paralysis of one vocal fold, and results in inability to close the vocal folds completely. If the vocal folds do not close completely, the voice is weak and hoarse and there may be choking on swallowing due to food or liquids going into the windpipe.</p>
