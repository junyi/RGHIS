    <span style="color:#666666;line-height:18px">Orthodontics deals with the arrangement
    of teeth and the way teeth come together (the bite). Orthodontic treatment aims at
    bringing teeth and jaws into a harmonious position with the face. This may improve
    the appearance, oral health and function. Positive results can be achieved by
    informed and cooperative patients.<br />

    Braces?</strong></span><br />
    People have their teeth straightened for a variety of reasons. These include: dental
    health, appearance, speech, better chewing etc. Among these, dental health is the
    most important. Poorly aligned or crooked teeth are difficult to keep clean. They
    often give rise to decay and gum problems.<br />

    "color:#00cccc;line-height:18px"><strong>Orthodontic Treatment Takes
    Time</strong></span><br />
    Braces used in orthodontic treatment need time to work. This generally takes two to
    three years. The braces are fixed permanently on the teeth until the completion of
    treatment. Special appliances called retainers are fitted after braces treatment to
    hold the teeth in their new positions.<br />
    <br />
    For treatment to progress smoothly, you need to maintain good oral hygiene by
    brushing regularly, especially after every meal and snack. Remember to bring a travel
    toothbrush with you when you are not at home. Avoid eating hard, sticky foods and
    keep to your orthodontic appointments faithfully.<br />

    "color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">When is the Best Time to Start
    Treatment?</span></strong><br />
    This depends on the type of orthodontic problem. For jaw-related cases, treatment
    generally starts while the child is still growing. This is between the ages of 9 and
    11. For mal-aligned teeth not related to jaw problems, treatment can generally be
    delayed until all the primary teeth (milk teeth) have changed to permanent
    ones.<br />
    <br />
    There is no age limit for orthodontic treatment. Adults can also benefit from
    orthodontic treatment.<br />

    Consultation</span></strong><br />
    On your first visit, the orthodontist will examine the general condition of your gum,
    teeth and jaws. Depending on your oral condition, he/she will advise you on the need
    for treatment. Other essential information, including the costs, type and duration of
    treatment will also be discussed. If treatment is recommended, special X-rays of the
    teeth and jaws will be taken for a more detailed diagnosis.<br />

    Treatment</span></strong><br />
    For most people, orthodontic treatment is an elective procedure; this means they can
    choose to have or not have treatment. It is rare that teeth will be lost if treatment
    is not started. There are alternative solutions to orthodontic problems. These are:
    prosthodontic treatments using tooth veneers, crowns, bridges or dentures; or no
    treatment at all. The orthodontist will discuss the risks and benefits of each
    alternative with you.<br />

    Many people are worried about the pain and attention braces bring. Adapting to braces
    can be both easy and fast. Some mild discomfort will be experienced in the first
    week. Subsequently, you can eat or even play musical instruments as normal. Colour
    and transparent bands are available to add variety to the look of your braces.<br />

    "color:#00cccc;line-height:18px"><strong>Points to Note on Orthodontic
    Treatment<br />
    Factors known to influence treatment result</strong></span><br />
    <br />
    <strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">1. Poor Oral
    Hygiene</span></strong><br />
    Teeth not kept clean during treatment increase the risk of tooth decay or creates
    white spots on the teeth. The gums and supporting bone may also become inflamed if
    bacterial plaque is not removed daily.<br />
    <br />
    <strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">2. Failing to comply with the
    use of braces and accessories</span></strong><br />
    This is the most common cause of inferior results and increased treatment time.<br />
    <br />
    <strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">3. Missed
    appointments</span></strong><br />
    Treatment time is lengthened. In addition, missing appointments may affect the
    quality of the end result.<br />
    <br />
    <strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Factors of an unpredictable
    nature, not within clinical control</span></strong><br />
    Like all medical and dental treatment, orthodontic treatment has certain limitations
    and potential risks that you should be aware of. Do ask questions at the
    consultation, before treatment starts.<br />
    <br />
    <strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">1. Damage to the nerve of the
    tooth</span></strong><br />
    Sometimes, a tooth may have suffered a knock in a previous accident, or a tooth may
    have large fillings which can cause damage to the nerve of the root. Orthodontic
    tooth movement may aggravate these conditions and root canal treatment to remove the
    nerve of the root may be neccessary.<br />
    <br />
    <strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">2. Root
    Shortening</span></strong><br />
    In some patients, the roots of the teeth may be shortened during treatment. Usually,
    this is of no practical consequence, but sometimes, it may become a threat to the
    longevity of the tooth. If severe shortening occurs, treatment may have to be stopped
    before it is finished. Root shortening can occur with or without orthodontic
    treatment. Trauma, pressure from other teeth and endocrine disorders are other
    causes. Orthodontic treatment may increase this possibility.<br />
    <br />
    <span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px"><strong>3. Relapse</strong></span><br />
    Teeth have a tendency to return toward their original position; this is called a
    relapse. The use of retainers help prevent this. All parts of the body continue to
    change throughout life, including teeth. This is a long-term process that can lead to
    changes in the bite or in the position of the teeth. One common example is the
    crowding of the lower front teeth in some people as they age.<br />
    <br />
    <span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px"><strong>4. Abnormal growth and
    development</strong></span><br />
    Growth disharmony and unusual tooth development are biological processes beyond the
    orthodontist's control. An unusual skeletal pattern and unfavorable grwoth may affect
    the final result. Surgical correction may sometimes be indicated during the course of
    orthodontic treatment.</font><br />
