<h2>What causes Pterygium?<br>
 </h2>
The exact cause of pterygium is still not known, and is thought to be due to multiple factors interacting together. However, ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun has been proven to be the most likely contributing factor. Exposure to long-hours of sunlight outdoors and in dry, dusty conditions seems to play an important role. <br>
