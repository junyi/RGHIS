            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes </span></h2>
            <p><strong>What causes headaches?</strong></p>
            <p>Most headaches have a genetic basis, i.e. it runs in the family. The patient may have other family members who also suffer from headache disorder and may also be sensitive to certain triggers that can lead to a headache attack. Lessen the impact of a headache by identifying and avoiding specific triggers, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>External environment - weather, smell and sound </li>
                <li>Emotion and stress </li>
                <li>Food and drink </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Keeping a headache diary will help to identify factors that have any relationship to the headache patterns.</p>
