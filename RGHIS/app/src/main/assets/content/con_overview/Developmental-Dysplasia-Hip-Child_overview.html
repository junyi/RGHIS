<h2>What Is Developmental Dysplasia Of The Hip (DDH)?</h2>
<p>Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) is a term commonly used in infants who have instability, or looseness, of the hip joint. The hip socket may be shallower than normal and not fully formed at birth. Therefore the hip does not fit properly and securely into the hip socket. The hip is either described as subluxable or dislocatable. </p>
<ul>
    <li>A subluxable hip is where the ball of the hip joint is able to move freely and loosely in the socket. </li>
    <li class=last>A dislocatable hip is where the ball of hip joint slides in and out of the socket. </li>
</ul>
