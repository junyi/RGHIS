<h2>Adapting to Baby</h2>
<h2>Adapting To Your Baby's Arrival</h2>
<p>The first few weeks with your baby may seem like a whirlwind of new experiences and emotions as you learn to cope with the new demands. These are some tips on how to prepare for and manage your newborn during this period.</p>
<h2>Taking Care Of Your Baby</h2>
<p>As a new parent, it is natural to be anxious or nervous at the prospect of such a responsibility. You and your spouse may already have signed up for parentcraft classes where nurses will show you how to bathe, feed and care for your baby.</p>
<p>You should take over the caring of your baby as soon as you feel up to it. This will help you to establish a bond with your baby. Bonding also gives you the opportunity to discover your baby's temperament and needs.</p>
<p>It is good to get someone to help with the household work while you and your husband concentrate on taking care of the baby. Encourage your husband to get involved in the care of the baby as this initiates the father and child relationship.</p>
<h2>Dealing With Your Own Emotions</h2>
<p>Some mothers feel a sense of closeness to their babies immediately after birth while others may take time to develop this.</p>
<p>Do not feel guilty if you need some time to bond with your baby or if you have thoughts of regret over the fact that your carefree days are over. These are normal emotions, so you should not dwell too much on them. Instead, concentrate on the new life that you are nurturing.</p>
<p>It is, however, advisable to share your feelings with your spouse, close ones and friends as you may discover that they too experienced similar emotions.</p>
<p>You will feel assured that what you are going through is commonly experienced by new mothers.</p>
<p>Some women experience mood swings during this period, or what is commonly termed postnatal blues. They may burst into tears for no apparent reason or feel depressed for a few days.</p>
<p>The sudden change in hormonal level, the anti-climax after birth and the fatigue due to a prolonged or complicated labour may be contributing factors to this.</p>
<p>The good news is that postnatal blues will go away. However, if it persists and you feel that you cannot cope with the baby and the demands of your family, consult your own doctor who will either prescribe medications or refer you for psychiatric counselling.</p>
<h2>Becoming A Family</h2>
<p>The arrival of your baby will bring a lot of changes into your life. Family relationships will change too.</p>
<p>No matter how topsy-turvy your life may seem at this time, try to make time for your husband. Often, the father is caught in a tangle of conflicting feelings.</p>
<p>He may feel an overwhelming sense of pride and be especially protective over the baby. On the other hand, he may regret too that his carefree days are over. He may also be nervous about handling the baby.</p>
<p>However, he will become more confident and less anxious if you involve him in the care of the newborn. Once both of you learn more about your baby, the two of you will settle down into the new routine.</p>
<p>Your mother and mother-in-law are also good sources of advice and help. Having taken care of their children, they would have a reservoir of experience on which you can tap.</p>
