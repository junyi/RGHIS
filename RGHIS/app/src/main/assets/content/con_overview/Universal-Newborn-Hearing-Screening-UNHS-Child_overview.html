<h2>Universal Newborn Hearing Screening</h2>
<h2>Why Does My Baby Need To Have A Hearing Screen?</h2>
<p>About one in 1,000 babies in Singapore has significant hearing impairment at birth and is at risk for delay in speech, language, intellectual, social and emotional development.</p>
<p>Each detection followed by appropriate intervention will minimise the harmful effects on the child's development. Without a screening test, this impairment may not be detected until much later.</p>
<p>Thus, the aim of the screening test is to detect hearing loss early in order to facilitate intervention and treatment as quickly as possible (preferably by 6 months of age).</p>
