<h2>Ear - Otitis Media</h2>
<h2>What Is Otitis Media With Effusion (OME)?</h2>
<p>OME, otherwise known as 'Glue Ear', is the collection of fluid in the middle ear. It occurs commonly in children and up to 60% of children having at least one episode by age 6 has been quoted in studies. It frequently happens after upper respiratory infection (flu) and in the majority of cases, it disappears. The length of time for the resolution varies and might take up to 3 months.</p>

<h2>What Causes OME?</h2>
<center></center>
<p>The problem is due to the blockage of the eustachian tube. This narrow canal connects the middle ear to the back of the nose, which allows ventilation and proper function of the middle ear sound-conduction mechanism. </p>
