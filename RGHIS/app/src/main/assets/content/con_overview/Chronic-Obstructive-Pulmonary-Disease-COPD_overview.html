            <p><span class=articletitle></span><span class=text><strong>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</strong> is a disease where both lungs are damaged and airways become irreversibly narrowed. It is also known as <strong>chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD)</strong> or <strong>chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD)</strong>. Patients present with breathlessness on exertion that progresses over time. In the end, breathlessness may occur even at rest. <br>
            <br>
            <strong><em>Is COPD the same as asthma? <br>
            <br>
            </em></strong>No. COPD usually caused by cigarette smoking while the cause of asthma is multifactorial. COPD tends to afflict the older population while asthma is more frequently seen in the young. The obstruction of the airways is usually fixed and progressive whereas in asthma it is usually reversible. <br>
            <strong><em><br>
            Is COPD contagious?</em></strong> <br>
            <br>
            No. As the cause is not an infectious agent, it is not contagious.<br>
