<p><span style="color:#666666;line-height:18px">Discoloured teeth may occur as a result of:
<ul>
    <li>extrinsic stains - stains which occur on the surface of the tooth. These stains can be removed by scaling and polishing. </li>
    <li>intrinsic stains - stains which occur within the tooth structure and cannot be removed by scaling and polishing. Some intrinsic stains can be removed by bleaching </li>
</ul>
</span></p></div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Introduction>
<strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Causes</span></strong><br>
Extrinsic stains can be caused by:
<ul>
    <li>Coloured compounds found in foods and drinks (eg. coffee, tea, red wine, colas, curries) </li>
    <li>Tobacco </li>
    <li>Poor oral hygiene </li>
    <li>Chromogenic (stain forming) bacteria which act on certain foods to produce black stains </li>
</ul>
<br>
<em><span style="color:#999999">External stains caused by tobacco use</span></em> <br>
<br>
Intrinsic stains can be caused by:
<ul>
    <li>Natural aging of teeth. </li>
    <li>Trauma to teeth </li>
    <li>Tooth decay (caries) </li>
    <li>Genetic factors </li>
    <li>Disturbance in formation of teeth from <br>
    - medication or chemicals eg tetracycline, excessive fluoride consumed during the tooth formative years<br>
    - illnesses which affect tooth development eg high fevers, metabolic disorders </li>
    <li>Root canal treatment <br>
    - teeth which no longer have a functioning pulp will change colour after some time </li>
</ul>

<strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Symptoms</span></strong><br>
Extrinsic stains apart from looking unsightly, do not cause symptoms. Intrinsic stains arising from tooth pathology, eg decay, will present with the corresponding symptoms of the pathology<br>
