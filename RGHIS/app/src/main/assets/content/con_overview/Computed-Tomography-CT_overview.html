            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p>This examination uses a digital imaging system and an x-ray scanner to obtain cross-sectional images of the body. These images will help your doctor in the diagnosis of your condition.</p>
            <a name=section2></a>
            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Procedure</span></h2>
            <p>You will be required to lie down on the examination table. The table is then moved partially into a tiltable tunnel which contains the X-ray scanner. </p>
            <p><strong>Preparation</strong> </p>
            <p>Please do not take any food or fluid 4 hours before the examination; <br>
            If you are on a medication called Metformin (Glucophage), do not take it 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days after, the CT examination;.<br>
            <br>
            For CT Pelvis, do not empty your bladder at least one hour before the scan. </p>
            <p><strong>On Arrival</strong> </p>
            <p>You will be required to change into a hospital gown. A locker will be provided for your belongings but please keep your valuables at home. </p>
            <p><strong>The CT Examination</strong> </p>
            <p>For higher radiation dose CT examinations, e.g. CT of the lumbar spine, you may be asked the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP) if you are a lady of child-bearing age. For lower dose examinations, you may be asked if there is any possibility you may be pregnant. </p>
            <p>Depending on the examination, a needle may be introduced into a vein on your hand for injection of a dye to enable clearer diagnosis.</p>
            <p>CT of the abdomen and/or pelvis will require drinking of a special fluid to better visualise the bowels.</p>
            <p>Please keep still for the entire procedure to help us obtain the clearest images for you. The examination usually takes 10 - 30 minutes, depending on the region being scanned. </p>
            <p>Due to the nature of our work, we have to give priority to emergency cases, and may not be able to keep strictly to schedule.</p>
            <p>If you have any question about the examination, do not hesitate to ask the radiographer attending to you.</p>
            <p><strong>After The Examination</strong></p>
            <p>Please do not change out of your hospital gown immediately after the examination. It may be necessary to do some additional views/sequences after the initial images were processed and reviewed.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Results of the examination</span></h2>
            <p>The radiologist will review the images and report the findings to your physician, who will then discuss the results with you on your next appointment. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Possible Risks</span></h2>
            <p>CT does involve exposure to radiation in the form of x-ray, but the benefit of an accurate diagnosis far outweighs the risk. Nursing mothers should wait for 24 hours after contrast material injection before resuming breast feeding.</p>
            <p>The risk of serious allergic reaction to iodine-containing contrast material is rare, and radiology departments are well-equipped to deal with them. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Limitations</span></h2>
            <p>X-ray imaging is not usually indicated for pregnant women.</p>
