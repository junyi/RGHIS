            <p>Barium Swallow </p>
            <ul>
                <li>During the examination, you may be asked to stand and drink the barium solution. The radiologist will take x-ray films of your upper digestive tract. </li>
                <li>Due to the nature of our work, some examinations may take longer than anticipated and we may not be able to keep strictly to schedule. </li>
                <li>If you have any question about the examination, do not hesitate to ask the radiographer attending to you. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Barium Meal </p>
            <ul>
                <li>An injection is sometimes given to relax the muscles of the bowel. During the examination, the doctor will ask you to swallow some effervescent powder to outline the stomach better. Following that, the barium solution is drunk to outline the stomach and intestines. You will then be asked to turn in different positions on the x-ray couch while x-ray images are being taken. </li>
                <li>Due to the nature of our work, some examinations may take longer than anticipated and we may not be able to keep strictly to schedule. </li>

                <li>During the examination, you will be lying down on the x-ray couch. An injection is usually given. The radiologist then inserts a tube into the rectum and runs the barium solution through it<br>
                . </li>
                <li>After that, you will be asked to turn in different positions while x-ray images of the large intestine are taken. The radiologist may pump some air in to visualise the bowels better, and this may cause some abdominal discomfort. </li>
                <li>Due to the nature of our work, some examinations may take longer than anticipated and we may not be able to keep strictly to schedule. </li>

            <br>
            </strong></em></span></em><span class=text>Please do not change out of your hospital gown immediately after the examination. It may be necessary to do some additional views after the initial images were processed and reviewed.<br>
            <br>
            You may need to go to the lavatory after the procedure. You may expect to see white stools for the next 1-2 days, due to the barium solution.
            <p>Once you are allowed to go back, please drink lots of fluid to avoid constipation.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Possible Risks </span></h2>
            <p>As with all procedures utilizing ionizing radiation, the radiation risks are present. However, the benefits of an accurate diagnosis far outweigh the risks. </p>
            <p>In rare cases, the barium suspension could leak through an undetected perforation in the lower gastrointestinal tract, producing inflammation in surrounding tissues. </p>
            <p>Even more rarely, the barium can cause an obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract, called barium impaction.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Limitations</span> </h2>
            <p>A barium enema is usually not indicated for someone who is in extreme abdominal pain or had a recent colonic biopsy. If perforation is suspected, the study should be performed with iodinated solution, instead of a barium suspension. </p>
            <p>X-ray imaging is not usually indicated for pregnant women.</p>
