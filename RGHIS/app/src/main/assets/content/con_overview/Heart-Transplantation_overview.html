            <p>The National Heart Centre Singapore (NHCS) set up the heart transplant programme in 1990, and is the only healthcare institution in Singapore that carries out heart transplantations. Heart transplantation is an established treatment for advanced heart disease. Since the advent of ciclosporin and other medications to control organ rejection, the survival rate of heart transplant patients has improved significantly. About 80 per cent of heart transplant patients survive past the first year. Heart transplantation is the replacement of a damaged or diseased heart with a healthy one from a donor who has suffered brain death but remains on life-support.</p>
