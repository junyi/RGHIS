            <p><strong>Electrocardiogram (ECG)</strong> is a non-invasive (does not require an incision into the body) test that records the electrical activity of the heart. The electrical activity is related to the impulses that travel through the heart that determines the heart rate and rhythm. These electrical impulses, which cause your heart to contract and relax, are detected by an electrocardiographic machine and are transformed in the form of waves that can be displayed on a graph or monitor. <br>
            <br>
            This test helps the doctor evaluate the patients cardiac condition, e.g. if there are any irregular heart rhythm or abnormal ECG morphology.</p>

                        <p>You will be asked to lie on an examination couch while the medical technologist puts 10 electrodes directly onto your chest, arms and legs. These electrodes are sticky patches that can help detect and conduct the electrical currents of your heart to the <strong>ECG machine</strong> so they can be recorded and printed for your doctor to review. <br>
                        <br>
                        You can breathe normally during the procedure but should not move, as this will disrupt the test results. After the procedure, the electrodes will be removed and you can resume your normal activity. <br>
                        <br>
                        The test takes about 5 to 8 minutes.</p>
