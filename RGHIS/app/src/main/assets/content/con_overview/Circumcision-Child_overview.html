<h2>Circumcision</h2>
<h2>What Is Circumcision?</h2>
<p>This is an operation to remove excess foreskin. It is performed if there is phimosis (tight foreskin opening), recurrent foreskin infections and for religious reasons. After circumcision, the glans penis (head of the penis) will remain exposed permanently.</p>
