<h2>Crying</h2>
<h2>Help! My Baby Is Crying</h2>
<p>Mothers frequently feel helpless when their babies cry excessively and nothing seems to pacify them. They do not know if the baby is ill, uncomfortable, afraid or just naughty. &quot;What should I do?&quot;, many ask. The following are some common reasons why babies cry and ways to pacify them when they do.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Hunger is the most common cause of crying in a baby. A feed will easily stop the crying. </li>
    <li>Thirst is another common reason. Babies who are fed strong preparations of cow's milk formula tend to get thirsty easily. The weather has a part to play too. Offering your baby some water to quench his thirst will stop the crying. </li>
    <li>Pain could also be the cause. A baby in pain tends to cry in a high pitched gasping scream. It is often difficult to determine where the baby is hurting and what is causing it. Pain experienced by babies is often associated with abdominal &quot;wind&quot;.
    <ul>
        <li>Wind trapped in his gut after feeds may cause pain. Try burping him. You may adopt any of the following positions when burping your baby: Hold him against your chest with his head resting on your shoulder, turn him over with his torso resting on your lap, or let him sit on your lap. </li>
        <li>Colic can also cause pain in babies in their first three months. Colic is an attack of abdominal pain caused by spasmodic contractions of the intestines. Although the exact cause of infant colic is not known, several factors such as excessive swallowing of air, rapid feeding, over feeding, excitement and milk allergy are contributory factors. An anxious or easily disturbed mother can also affect the baby. To relieve the pain, cuddle your baby gently and give him warm water to drink. To help your baby relax, you may give him the pacifier, rock him gently or pat him. </li>
        <li>Infections of the ear and throat as well as teething cause pain and fever in the baby. Medical advice must be sought immediately. </li>
        <li>Obstructions in intestines or stomach cause pain but they are rare. Babies with this condition cry excessively and may vomit. They should be taken to the doctor immediately. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Babies are sensitive to temperature. If your baby is cold, he will cry. Take him to a warm room or add an extra layer of clothing. Also give him a cuddle. These should stop his crying. When a crying baby is irritable, he could be feeling hot. Take him out of his cot for some fresh air or change him into something cooler. If he is running a fever, give him extra fluids and seek medical advice immediately. </li>
    <li>Babies cry if they are wet and dirty or if they have itchy rashes. Clean your baby and change the diaper. </li>
    <li>A loud noise or a strong light that shines on the baby's face may cause a baby to be frightened. A baby who is left alone in a dark room may cry because he is afraid and alone. Many mothers fail to realise that even very young babies need company. </li>
    <li>From the 6th month, a child develops his own ego and personality. He may show strong likes and dislikes and may cry when not given what he wants. </li>
    <li>From the 9th month, the child may show signs of jealousy. He may cry when he sees his mother picking up another baby. Excessive crying during this period is almost always due to the child's need for comfort, love and security. </li>
</ol>
