<h2>What is Plagiocephaly?</h2>
<p>Plagiocephaly is the most common craniofacial problem today. Positional plagiocephaly, means a mis-shapen or uneven (asymmetrical) head shape. Plagiocephaly does not affect the development of a baby's brain, but if not treated it may change their physical appearance by causing uneven growth of their face and head.<br>
