            <p><strong>Clubfoot</strong> is a congenital condition where the forefoot (part of the foot connected to the lower leg bone) is abnormally twisted relative to the lower leg bone. </p>

            <p><strong>Congenital Talipes Equino Varus (CTEV)</strong> is a condition where the sole of the foot is turned inwards and backwards. In <strong>Congenital Talipes Calcano Valgus (CTCV),</strong> the sole is turned outwards and upwards. The condition may affect one or both feet. </p>

            <p>The deformity of the foot may be due to prolonged positioning in the uterus (womb) and the limited mobility, an abnormal uterine shape or a lack of amniotic fluid. </p>
            <p>In most babies where the clubfoot is postural, the forefoot can be passively moved through a complete range of motion. In some babies, the clubfoot is structural and the joint deformity appears fixed and the forefoot cannot be passively moved through its full range of motion. </p>
            <p>If both feet are affected, the doctor may look for abnormalities at the lower end of your babyвЂ™s spine. </p>
