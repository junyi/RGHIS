            <p>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a major cause of limb loss in Singapore. However it does not receive as much attention as diseases involving the other vascular beds: namely, coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease. Yet it is a good predictor of heart attack and stroke risk.</p>

            <p>PAD develops when arteries in the legs become clogged with plaque  such as fatty deposits and cholesterol  that limits or completely blocks blood flow in the legs. This causes muscle pains in the calves, thighs, and buttocks. </p>
            <p>Like atherosclerosis, PAD is caused by the buildup of fatty deposits   called plaque   in the arteries. Having blocked arteries can keep oxygen-rich blood from reaching the muscles when the muscles need it most. This lack of oxygen causes the pain. PAD can increase your risk of heart attack and stroke. But the good news is that PAD can be easy to diagnose and is treatable.</p>
            <p>With pain limiting their movements, the patients move gradually from an active lifestyle to a sedentary one. This results in immobility and a shorter life expectancy due to the increased risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke. </p>

            <p>The risk factors for PAD include hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes  all of which are common illnesses in our population. One-third of diabetics over the age of 50 develop the disease. <br>
            <br>
            Another high-risk activity, such as smoking, brings on the disease much sooner. So PAD patients, who otherwise would be in their late 70s or 80s, could start to feel symptoms as early as their 50s or 60s. </p>
