            <p>An acoustic neuroma (also called vestibular schwannoma) is a non-cancerous growth that arises from the eighth cranial nerve.<br>
            <br>
             The eighth (VIII) cranial nerve has two divisions: <br>
            1) the cochlear division  associated with transmitting hearing 2) the vestibular division  associated with sending balance information from the inner ear to the brain. <br>
            These two parts pass through a bony canal called the internal auditory canal to reach the brain. The seventh (VII) cranial nerve (also called the Facial Nerve as it controls facial movements) and important blood vessels also pass through this canal. It is here that acoustic neuromas usually begin to grow from the tissue surrounding the vestibular division of the eighth cranial nerve. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes</span></h2>
            <p><strong>What causes Acoustic Schwannoma?<br>
            </strong><br>
            The cause is not known, except for a small percentage of individuals in whom both sides of the eighth cranial nerve are involved. In these instances there is often a hereditary factor.</p>
            <p><strong>What is its growth pattern? </strong></p>
            <p>Acoustic neuromas are slow growing tumours, and usually enlarge by 1mm to 3mm per year, while some may grow by more than 5mm per year. In some 9-21% of patients, the growth can remain inert for several years, and in a small proportion of patients (6-15%), its growth can even regress with time. </p>
