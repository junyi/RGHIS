            Causes</span></h2>
            <p>There are two sphincter muscles in the oesophagus  the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) and upper oesophageal sphincter (UES). <br>
            <br>
            The LES is a muscle that prevents back-flow of food and acid from the stomach into the oesophagus. The UES is a muscle that prevents food and acid in the oesophagus from back-flowing into the larynx. When the LES is weak and does not close tightly, you will have gastrooesophageal reflux disease or GERD. <br>
            <br>
            If acid (and digestive enzymes) from the stomach back-flows into the larynx, you will have laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR).</p>
