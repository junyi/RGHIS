            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Preventing Falls in the Older Person</span></h2>
            <p>Falling is part of growing up, as they say. Unfortunately, when we are above the age of 65, falling may lead to injuries, such as fractures, which affect your normal activities. </p>
            <p>As you grow older, your bodily functions change or deteriorate. For example, </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sense of balance reduces </li>
                <li>Response time slows down </li>
                <li>Muscles weaken </li>
                <li>Vision becomes poor </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Medical conditions may increase the risk of falls, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stroke and Parkinsons disease that cause balance and walking disorders </li>
                <li>Heart and lung diseases </li>
                <li>Joint disorders, like arthritis </li>
                <li>Bladder conditions </li>
                <li>Depression </li>
                <li>Dementia </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Medications can also be a risk for falls. Diuretics, sedatives or anti-hypertensive medications can predispose you to fall as you grow older.</p>
