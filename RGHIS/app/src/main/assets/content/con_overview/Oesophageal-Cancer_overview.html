            <p><strong>What is Oesophageal Cancer?<br>
            </strong><br>
            The oesophagus is the tube that connects the mouth and throat to the stomach. In the chest, it lies behind the windpipe or trachea. Further down, it passes through an opening in the diaphragm, the muscle that lies between the lungs and the stomach. After passing through the diaphragm, the oesophagus joins the stomach. Where the oesophagus joins the stomach is a valve to prevent food from passing backward from stomach to oesophagus. The cells of the inner lining of the oesophagus can become cancers.</p>
            <p><strong>How common is Oesophageal Cancer?</strong><br>
            <br>
            There is a decreasing trend for oesophageal cancer. Between 2005 to 2009, there were about 334 reported cases in Singapore. However, it is the 8th most frequent cancer deaths in Singapore among the males according to the Singapore Cancer registry.</p>
            <p><strong>Age of Onset</strong><br>
            <br>
            Oesophageal cancer occurs most commonly in the elderly. It is more common in men than women.</p>

            Causes and Risks</span></h2>
            <p>Nitrosamines and alcohol have been implicated in the high incidence of oesophageal cancer in certain countries. Nitrosamines are found as food preservatives.</p>
            <p>Certain benign oesophageal diseases have been known to predispose to oesophageal cancer. Patients with achalasia, an oesophageal disease due to incoordinated contractions of the oesophagus leading to difficulty swallowing, have a seven times higher incidence of oesophageal cancer. Previous injury to the oesophagus due to caustic soda also predisposes to cancer. Conditions such as Barrett's disease where the lining of the oesophagus is different, Plummer-Vinson syndrome where a web forms over the opening of the oesophagus into the stomach, all predispose to oesophageal cancer.</p>
            <p>Tylosis, an inherited condition characterised by thickening of the palms and soles, has a high association with oesophageal cancer.</p>
