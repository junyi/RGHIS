            <p>Myocarditis is the inflammation of the heart muscle due to infections, usually viral. This inflammation may eventually lead to global weakening and dilatation of the heart muscle causing severe heart failure (dilated cardiomyopathy). Certain viruses are known to cause myocarditis but the exact mechanism leading to the weakening of the heart muscle is unknown.</p>
