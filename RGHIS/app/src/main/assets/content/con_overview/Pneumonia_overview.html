            <p>Pneumonia is inflammation of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria. The air sacs in the lungs are filled with pus and when the infection is severe, oxygen has trouble reaching the blood. More than half of the cases of pneumonia are caused by bacteria. Other causes include viruses, mycoplasma and others (parasites and fungi).</p>
