            <p>Gout is the result of deposits of needle like crystals of uric acid in the joint spaces. Uric acid, a substance that results from the breakdown of purines in the body, usually dissolves in the blood and passes through the kidneys into the urine. In people with gout, the uric acid level in the blood becomes elevated.<br>
            <br>
            This is called hyperuricaemia and can be due either to the increased production of uric acid eg. due to consumption of food rich in purines or decreased excretion of uric acid from the kidney eg. renal impairment.</p>
