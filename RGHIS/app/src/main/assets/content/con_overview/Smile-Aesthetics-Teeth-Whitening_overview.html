<strong>Dentist-supervised home bleaching</strong><br>
For this method, bleaching is done at your convenience, usually at home in the evening and your dentist will monitor your progress to ensure that the bleaching is carried out optimally.<br>
<br>
A customized bleaching tray is first made of your teeth.  You will be provided with syringes of the bleaching gel (usually carbamide peroxide based) and taught how to apply the bleaching gel onto the bleaching tray. One wears the tray daily for an hour or two each day and teeth will gradually lighten in shade.<br>
<br>
<strong>In-office chairside bleaching</strong><br>
Bleaching is carried out with the patient seated on the dental chair. In most cases, a satisfactory result can be achieved in one treatment visit and therefore offers convenience to those with busy schedules or who wish to achieve results in a short time. This method is usually more costly than the dentist supervised home bleaching method.<br>
<br>
There are many in-office bleaching systems available, most of which use the hydrogen peroxide base bleaching gel. These systems may require some form of light activation from different light sources (eg, laser, plasmaarc light) to speed up the bleaching process. The bleaching gel is placed on to the tooth structure and the process activated with the light source. The entire treatment typically takes about 2 hours, including preparations. Sometimes, more treatment visits may be necessary to achieve a satisfactory result, depending on the intensity of tooth discolouration.<br>
