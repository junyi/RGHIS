<h2>Ovarian Cancer</h2>
<h2>What Are Ovaries?</h2>
<p>Ovaries produce eggs and female hormones during a womans reproductive life. Women have two ovaries, one on either side of the uterus (womb) in the lower abdomen.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2>How Does Ovarian Cancer Develop?</h2>
<p>The organs and tissues of the body are made up of tiny building blocks called cells. When your bodys cells are healthy, they grow and divide to make new cells. When old cells die, new ones take their place.<br>
<br>
Cancer is a disease of these cells. A cancerous tumour starts from one abnormal cell. However, the exact reason why a cell becomes cancerous is unclear.<br>
<br>
Cancerous tumours have the ability to spread beyond the original site, and if left untreated, it may invade and destroy surrounding tissues. Sometimes, cells break away from the original (primary) cancer and spread to other organs in the body via the bloodstream or lymphatic system. When these cells reach a new site they may continue to divide and form a new tumour, often referred to as 'metastasis'.</p>
<h2>Types Of Ovarian Cancer</h2>
<p>There are various types of ovarian cancer. They are classified by the type of cell from<br>
which the cancer originates.</p>
<font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Epithelial ovarian cancer</strong> is the most common. This type of cancer develops from one of the cells that surround the exterior of each ovary. </li>
    <li><strong>Germ cell ovarian cancer</strong> develops from germ cells (the cells that make the eggs). </li>
    <li><strong>Stromal ovarian cancer</strong> develops from connective tissue cells (the cells that fill the ovary). </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p> </p>
<h2>What Causes Ovarian Cancer?</h2>
<p>In most cases, the reason why an ovarian cancer develops is not known. However, there are some factors which increase your risk.</p>
<h2>Factors That Increase Your Risk</h2>
<font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div>
<ul>
    <li>Your risk increases as you get older. Most women who get ovarian cancer are 50 years old and above, but younger women can get it too. </li>
    <li>If you have never had children or been pregnant, your risk of developing ovarian cancer may increase. </li>
    <li>Having other cancers. If you have had breast cancer, colon cancer, or cancer of the uterus (womb) or rectum, your risk of getting ovarian cancer may increase. </li>
    <li>Family history of ovarian cancer. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Factors That Decrease Your Risk</h2>
<font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div>
<ul>
    <li>Pregnancy </li>
    <li>Breastfeeding </li>
    <li>Oral contraceptives provide some protection from ovarian cancer. This protection seems to continue for many years after stopping the pill. </li>
    <li>Sterilisation or hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) may reduce the risk slightly. </li>
</ul>
