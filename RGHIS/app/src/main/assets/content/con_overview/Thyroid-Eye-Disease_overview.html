<h1 class=sectionbanner>THYROID EYE DISEASE (TED)</h2>
<p><em>Bulging eyes, excessive tearing and pain, dryness, redness and discomfort in the eyes could signal thyroid disease.</em></p>
<h2>What is Thyroid Eye Disease?</h2>
<p>Thyroid eye disease (TED) is an eye condition related to thyroid disease. Thyroid hormones produced by the thyroid gland in the neck regulate metabolism in the body. Patients with excessive thyroid hormone in the circulation (hyperthyroidism) can develop eye diseases and they may have any of the following symptoms:</p>
<p> Neck swelling from an enlarged thyroid gland (goitre)<br>
 Heat intolerance<br>
 Sweatiness<br>
 Increase in appetite and loss of weight<br>
 Tremors<br>
 Palpitations<br>
 Tiredness<br>
 Anxiety, nervousness and bad temper</p>
<p>The most significant, but rare, complication of thyroid disease is loss of vision due to compression of the optic nerve by swollen tissues around the eye. Swelling of the orbital tissues can cause the eyes to bulge outwards and limit the eye's ability to close the eyelids, exposing the front surface of the eye and causing irritation and damage to the cornea. Patients can also suffer from double vision due to marked swelling and stiffening of eye muscles.</p>

<h2>What causes Thyroid Eye Disease?</h2>
<p>Thyroid eye disease is more common in women and although often associated with hyperthyroidism, may occur in patients with normal or low thyroid hormone levels. Although the exact cause is unclear, what is known is that the body produces antibodies against its own tissues in the orbit.  This sets off a series of biochemical events that lead to swelling of the orbital soft tissues, specifically the eye muscles and orbital fat.</p>
