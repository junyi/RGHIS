<h2>Pelvic Floor</h2>
<h2>What Is The Pelvic Floor?</h2>
<p>This is an area in the body which is made up of muscles and supporting tissues (fascia) to provide support for the womb, bladder and rectum. If the pelvic floor is weak, the bladder, rectum and the womb may protrude out of the vagina.</p>
<h2>Why Is The Pelvic Floor Weak?</h2>
<p>This is often due to previous deliveries, menopause or excessive straining such as chronic cough, constipation or the presence of a pelvic mass.</p>
