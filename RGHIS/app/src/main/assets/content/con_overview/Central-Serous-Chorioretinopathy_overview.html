<h1 class=sectionbanner>CENTRAL SEROUS CHORIORETINOPATHY</h2>
<p><em>Blurred, wavy or distorted vision with the loss of sight in the centre of your vision could indicate a problem known as Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR).</em> </p>
<h2>What is Central Serous Chorioretinopathy?</h2>
<p>Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is a condition that affects the central part of the light-sensitive retina in the eye. This central area, known as the macula, is the most receptive to light. CSCR occurs when the layers of the retina separate due to the collection of fluid between them, as with a blister. This can cause temporary or permanent damage to vision.</p>
