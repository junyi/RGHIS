<h2>Senses</h2>
<h2>Sensory Defensiveness In Children</h2>
<p>Each of us has the ability to sense potential danger. We are able to respond to these events with an appropriate amount of defense. Some people have a tendency to respond to certain harmless sensations as if they were dangerous or painful. This is called &quot;sensory defensiveness&quot;.</p>
<h2>What Is Sensory Defensiveness?</h2>
<p>Sensory defensiveness is an over-activation of our protective senses. It is a tendency to react negatively or with alarm to sensations that are generally considered harmless or non-irritating. In children with sensory defensiveness, their clothes may feel like spiders on the skin and a flight of stairs may seem like a cliff to them. Common symptoms may include over-sensitivity or over-reaction to light or unexpected touch, sudden movement, high-pitched noises and certain smells. </p>
<p>Sensory defensiveness results in varying degrees of stress and anxiety with each child. The child with sensory defensiveness may perceive the world as dangerous, alarming or at the very least irritating. Children with sensory defensiveness can be described as sometimes over-active, emotional or sensory-avoiding. Learned patterns and habits are often developed around avoiding disrupting sensory events or seeking out sensation that might restore comfort. When sensory defensiveness dominates a child's behaviour, parents or caregivers may find it increasingly difficult to manage the child. For example, the child may frequently hit or bite other children at school, throw temper tantrums during outings or destroy toys and books</p>
