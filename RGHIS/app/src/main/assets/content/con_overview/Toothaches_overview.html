<p><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px"><strong>I had a sudden toothache on one tooth. The gums are slightly swollen. I feel the tenderness when I touch it. After a few days, it subsided and I ignored it. A few days later, the problem recurred. What can I do about this?</strong></span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#666666;line-height:18px">Sudden excruciating pain or toothache may indicate the deep spread of decay in the tooth. Often, root canal treatment is necessary. If you note mild symptoms on the teeth, a check-up with your dentist will help prevent a bigger problem from occurring.<br>
