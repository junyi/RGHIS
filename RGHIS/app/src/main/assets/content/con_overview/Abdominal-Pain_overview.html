            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes </span></h2>
            <p>Causes include the stomach or intestines being distended with acid, food or air or going into spasm. These conditions are functional disorders as there is no visible disease causing the pain, and they are compatible with good health. </p>
            <p>Other and fortunately less common causes of abdominal pain are potentially more serious. Ulcers of the stomach or duodenum (also known as peptic ulcers disease) sometimes lead to life threatening bleeding or perforation. Gallstones may give rise to infection and obstruction of bile flow. A liver enlarged due to cancer can cause abdominal pain. </p>
            <p>Other conditions which can give rise to abdominal pain include infections, inflammation or growths in the oesophagus, pancreas, kidneys, small and large intestines, the uterus and ovaries. Such conditions due to visible disease of various organs are said to be structural disorders. </p>
            <p>One subgroup of structural disorders is known as the acute abdomen. These include conditions like acute appendicitis or perforated ulcer for which urgent surgery may be required. It is important for patients and doctors alike to differentiate between the functional causes of pain, which are fully compatible with good general health, and the structural causes, which usually require medical treatment. In particular, patients with acute abdomens must be identified as immediate hospital admission is required. </p>
