            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Dietary Fibre</span></h2>
            <p><strong>What is dietary fibre?</strong> <br>
            <br>
            Dietary fibre comprises any substance of the plant origin, which is not digestible by your body. It includes plant cell walls and supporting structures. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>In what way is dietary fibre beneficial to health?</strong> <br>
            <br>
            Fibre absorbs water in the intestines, which softens stools and expands its bulk. This stimulates the colon to discharge waste faster and reduces the concentration of harmful substances staying within the colon. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>How much fibre do you need? <br>
            <br>
            </strong>An average Singaporean consumes 13 grams of dietary fibre per day. The recommended amount is 30 grams per day. <br>
            <strong><br>
            Can too much fibre be harmful? <br>
            <br>
            </strong>No. However, it is important to have a balance diet. A sudden increase of fibre may also cause bloatedness because of excessive gas. This can be minimised by slowly increasing fibre intake over a period of 2-3 weeks. </p>
