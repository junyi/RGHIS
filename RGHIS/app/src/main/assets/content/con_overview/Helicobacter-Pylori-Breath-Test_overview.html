            <p>Helicobacter Pylori is a bacterium that can be found in the stomach and part of the gut. It is known to be associated with peptic ulcer. The Helicobacter Pylori Breath Test (HPBT) helps to determine the presence of this bacteria. It is a non-invasive procedure and is as safe as a normal chest x-ray. However it is not performed for pregnant or breast-feeding women or for children under 16 years of age.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Procedure</span></h2>
            <p>You will first rinse your mouth with water and then drink a small container of tasteless liquid containing the radioactive tracer. After 20 minutes you blow into a straw to collect your breath into another container containing a blue liquid. When the liquid becomes clear, enough breath has been collected. The container is then sent for analysis. </p>
            <p>You have to fast 6 hours before your appointment and stop antibiotics for at least 4 weeks and stomach medication for 14 days prior to your appointment.</p>
