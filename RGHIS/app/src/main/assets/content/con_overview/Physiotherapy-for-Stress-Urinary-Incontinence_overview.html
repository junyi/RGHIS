<h2>Physiotherapy for Stress Urinary Incontinence</h2>
<h2>What Is Stress Urinary Incontinence?</h2>
<p>Stress urinary incontinence is the uncontrollable loss of urine when you cough, sneeze or laugh. Any activity that results in an increase in pressure in the abdominal cavity may contribute to stress urinary incontinence. This happens when pelvic floor muscles have been weakened and the bladder has slipped lower. Stress urinary incontinence is a common medical condition and is treatable. Physiotherapy may be tried first, failing which surgery may be necessary.</p>

<h2>What Are The Causes:</h2>
<p>The commonest cause of stress urinary incontinence is due to hypermobility of the bladder neck and the proximal urethra, which result in the failure of transmission of the increased intra-abdominal pressure to the proximal urethra, preventing maintenance of closure of the urethra. Intrinsic sphincter deficiency - where a scarred, chronically open urethra is present, can also cause stress urinary incontinence.</p>
<h2>Common Precipitating Factors Are:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Pregnancy and vaginal delivery </li>
    <li>Repeated lifting of heavy objects </li>
    <li>Prolonged coughing </li>
    <li>Obesity </li>
    <li>Repeated straining during urination or bowel movement </li>
    <li class=last>Menopause </li>
</ul>
