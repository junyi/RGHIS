<h1 class=sectionbanner>PROLIFERATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY (PVR)</h2>
<p><em>One complication of retinal detachment is Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), a condition which prevents the retina from healing.</em></p>
<h2>What is Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy (PVR)?</h2>
<p>Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy (PVR) occurs when a scar forms under or on the retina after retinal detachment, preventing the retina from healing and falling back into place. ().</p>

<h2>What causes Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy (PVR)?</h2>
<p>One of the commonest causes of Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is failed repair of retinal detachment. When there is a hole in the retina, cells that normally reside under the retina enter the eyeball and settle on the inner layer of the eye on top of the retina. These cells multiply and form a scar on the surface (and sometimes under) the retina. This scar tissue then contracts and detaches the retina away from the innermost walls of the eye, resulting in a second retinal detachment.</p>

<h2>What are the risk factors for Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy (PVR)?</h2>
<p>Risk factors for Proliferative vitreoretinopathy PVR include large retina tears or retinal detachment that is not treated early. Bleeding within the eye, increased inflammation from trauma and previous retinal detachment operations also increase the risk.<br>
<br>
Many of the factors that increase the risk of PVR are the same as those of retinal detachment, such as , family history and after surgery for . Retinal detachments can also be caused by other diseases in the eye such as tumours, severe inflammation or complications from diabetes. Early detection and treatment of retinal detachment can prevent PVR from occurring, so regular  play an important preventative role.</p>
