<strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Treatment</span></strong><br>
Your periodontist may recommend surgery for the following reasons:
<ul>
    <li>If you have advanced gum disease that does not respond to non surgical management. You may need a <strong>flap surgery</strong> or pocket reduction surgery <br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'">         </span>An incision is made in the gums under local anaesthesia<br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'">         </span>The gums are folded away exposing the roots of the affected teeth<br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'">         </span>Residual tartar and infected tissue are removed and the root surfaces cleaned.<br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'">         </span>Affected bone is re -contoured <br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'">         </span>The flap is then sewn back around the tooth  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>To replace, regenerate tissue lost through gum disease<br>
     -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'">         </span>Some surgical procedures may be recommended to regenerate part of the bone and supporting tissues previously lost to disease.<br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'">         </span> Membranes and bone grafts are used to partially restore and strengthen the support of the teeth. This type of surgery is known <strong>as guided tissue</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"> </span><strong>regeneration / bone graft surgery</strong>.<br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'">         </span>Your graft may compose small fragments of your own bone or it may be synthetic or donated. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>to improve appearance/aesthetics of your gum line (<strong>muco-gingival surgery</strong>) <br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'">         </span>Exposed root surfaces of teeth due to gum recession result in a longer looking tooth which may contribute to a 'toothy' smile<br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'">         </span>A soft tissue graft taken from your palate or other areas in your mouth is used to cover the exposed root to give your tooth a more cosmetically pleasant appearance. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>to expose more of the tooth structure for a dental restoration <strong>(crown lengthening surgery)</strong> <br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'">         </span>If your tooth has decay below the gum line, or has insufficient tooth structure for a restoration surgery may be advised to adjust the gum and bone level to increase exposure of the tooth.<br>
    -<span style="font:7pt 'times new roman'">         </span>during this procedure, gum and bone tissue are reshaped to expose the extent of the decay or fracture. This will provide both sufficient tooth structure and accessibility for subsequent placement of a restoration. </li>
</ul>
