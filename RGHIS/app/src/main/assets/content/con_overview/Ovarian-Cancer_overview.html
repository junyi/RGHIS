            <p><strong>What is Ovarian Cancer?<br>
            </strong><br>
            Ovarian cancer refers to malignant growth arising from different parts of the ovaries. (Diagram of anatomy). The ovaries are part of a womans reproductive system, where the eggs are developed. Most ovarian cancers are classified as &quot;epithelial&quot; and arise from the surface (epithelium) of the ovary. Other types arise from the egg cells (germ cell tumor) or supporting cells (sex cord/stromal).</p>
            <p><strong>How common is Ovarian Cancer?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Ovarian cancer is the 5th commonest cancer in Singapore. There are 280 cases diagnosed yearly based on the Singapore Cancer Registry 2005-2009. It is the second most common female genital tract cancer.</p>
            <p><strong>Age of Onset</strong><br>
            <br>
            Epithelial ovarian cancer usually affects older women although it can also happen to younger women. Germ cell cancers of the ovary occur more frequently in younger women.</p>

            Causes and Risks</span></h2>
            <p>Risk factors associated with ovarian cancer include:- </p>
            <ul>
                <li>late pregnancy </li>
                <li>early onset of menstruation </li>
                <li>late menopause </li>
                <li>never had children-history of breast cancer </li>
                <li>genetic predisposition </li>
                <li>endometriosis </li>
            </ul>
            Ovarian cancer is known to run in some families where family members may have increased risk of getting ovarian, breast and endometrial cancer(eg BRCA gene abnormalities) or increased risk of getting endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer in addition to ovarian cancer (Lynch syndrome). In women who have a sister or mother with this disease, the risk of developing ovarian cancer is increased twenty-fold. Ovarian cancer also runs in certain families with a history of breast and colon cancers. There is now evidence to suggest that certain genes are involved in causing these diseases. </div>
