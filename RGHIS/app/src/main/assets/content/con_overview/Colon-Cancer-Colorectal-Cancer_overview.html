            <p><strong>What is Colorectum Cancer?<br>
            </strong><br>
            Colorectal cancer is a cancer that develops from the cells of the large intestine. The large intestine is made up of the colon and rectum. The rectum comprises the last 15cm of the large intestine and lies within the pelvis which is made up of the hip bones. This is a very small area and the distance between the cancer and the surrounding normal organs is very short. Hence, the chance of the cancer spreading to neighbouring organs in the pelvis is significant.</p>
            <p>The colon forms the rest of the large intestine which lies above the level of the hips. It is surrounded by fatty tissue, called omentum, and anchored by more fatty tissue, called mesentery, to the walls of the abdominal cavity. In the mesentery are the lymph glands.</p>
            <p>Cancer can develop from the cells lining of the large intestine. The cancer can cause blockage of the intestine, or bleeding into faeces.</p>
            <p><strong>How common is Colorectum Cancer?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Colorectum cancer is now the commonest cancer in Singapore affecting both males and females. There were about 1580 cases were diagnosed from 2005-2009 locally.</p>
            <p><strong>Age of Onset</strong><br>
            <br>
            Most persons diagnosed with Colorectal cancer are older than 45 years of age. Younger persons, less than 20 years of age, if diagnosed to have Colorectum cancer are likely to be hereditary form of Colorectum cancer, such as familial adenomatous polyposis.</p>
