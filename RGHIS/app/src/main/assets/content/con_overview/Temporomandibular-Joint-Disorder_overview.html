<p><span style="color:#666666;line-height:18px">Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) is a group of conditions that cause pain and loss of normal function to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) or jaw joint. The temporormandibular joint is located in front of the ear, on both sides of the head. The joint is made up of the lower jawbone and the skull. A cartilage disk, which functions as a shock absorber and joint lubricant, separates these 2 bones. The TMJ and the muscles of chewing enable you to open your mouth, talk and chew.  <br>
<br>
Temporomandibular joint disorder can originate from the different components of the joint, namely,
<ul>
    <li>The muscles (of chewing) </li>
    <li>The cartilage disk </li>
    <li>The bone of the joint ( the jawbone and skull bone ) </li>
</ul>

Temporormandibular joint disorder can be caused by:
<ul>
    <li>Prolonged stress to the Jaw joint - Habitual clenching or grinding of your teeth overloads the joint causing pain in the joint and muscles. You may not be aware of these habits if they occur during sleep. </li>
    <li>Trauma - A recent trauma or a history of trauma, such as a blow to the lower jaw or face, directly or indirectly, can injure the TMJ. </li>
    <li>Arthritis - The jaw joint may be damaged by arthritis (inflammation of the joint). Arthritis may be a degenerative process due to aging or it may be associated with medical conditions such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis. </li>
</ul>
<strong>In many cases the cause of TMD may not be clear.</strong> <br>
