            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p>Normally a baby boys testicles move into his scrotal sac from his abdomen before he is born. Sometimes this does not happen as it should. This condition is called undescended testicles. Usually only one testicle is affected but in some cases both testicles may be undescended. <br>
            <br>
            This condition is more common in premature boys. It is not related to the mothers diet or activity during pregnancy. </p>

            Risk</span></h2>
            <p>Leaving a testicle in an abnormal position may affect the growth and development of the testicle. There may also be a risk of hernia with the undescended testicle, and it can twist and become more prone to injury.</p>

            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>The babys doctor will usually check for undescended testicles at birth and at the regular baby reviews. Some boys may need a referral to a paediatric surgeon if the testicles are not in position. This condition can usually be checked by a doctor during a physical examination alone. In general, scans are not required unless nothing can be felt. </p>
