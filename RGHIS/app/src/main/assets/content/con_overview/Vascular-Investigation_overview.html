            <p>Vascular Investigation consists of one or a combination of laboratory tests which include imaging the blood vessels with a duplex scan or measuring the blood flow and pressure in the vascular system using specialised machines.</p>
            <p>A duplex scan is an ultrasound scan that uses high frequency sound waves to image the blood vessels in the body to assess their potency and to document any abnormalities. </p>

            <p>For an abdominal scan, you are required to fast at least eight hours before the scan to eliminate gas in the abdomen.</p>
            <p>For all other scans, you may eat, go about your normal activity and continue to take medications prescribed by your doctor, unless otherwise informed.</p>
            <p>You can carry out normal activities before and after the scan.</p>

            How is the test done<a class=ms-asset-internalBookmark id="How is the test done" title="How is the test done"> </a></span></h2>
            <p>Before the start of the scan, your medical history will be noted and a physical measurement will be carried out to detect conditions such as presence of pulses, pain, ulcers or swelling. You may be required to change into a gown.</p>
            <p>You will be asked to lie on your back and a coupling gel will be applied to the intended area to ensure a good transmission of the ultrasound.</p>
            <p>The blood vessels will be examined and an assessment will be made from the images on the screen. The images will also be video-taped and kept as a record.</p>
            <p>The whole procedure will take between 1 to 2 hours depending on the type of investigation requested. A report will be sent to your doctor who will discuss the results with you on your subsequent clinic consultation. </p>
