            <p><strong>What is Cervix Cancer?<br>
            </strong><br>
            The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) (diagram). Cancers that arise in the cervix are potentially curable if detected in the early stage hence early detection is t the key to improving survival. Most cervical cancers are of the type called squamous cell carcinomas.</p>
            <p><strong>How common is Cervix Cancer?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Cervix cancer is the 7th most common female cancer in Singapore. About 200 cases are diagnosed every year.</p>
            <p><strong>Age of Onset</strong><br>
            <br>
            Pre-invasive cancer often occurs in women in their late 20s to 30s.These are termed as CIN (Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia). These are changes in the lining of the cervix which can lead to cervix cancer. With time, these pre-cancerous lesions can progress and become invasive cancer if left untreated.</p>

            Causes and Risks</span></h2>
            <p>Infection with Human Papilloma viruses (HPV) is the most common cause or risk factor for cervical cancer. These viruses are transmitted during sexual intercourse, as well as via oral or anal sex. Any female who has ever been sexually active is at potential risk. </p>
            <p>Other risk factors include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Onset of sexual activity before age 20 </li>
                <li>Multiple sexual partners </li>
                <li>a history of sexually transmitted infections </li>
                <li>A male sexual partner with a history of sexually transmitted infections and or extramarital sexual activity </li>
                <li>A male sexual partner with sexual partner(s) with previous cancer of the cervix has been established as a potential risk </li>
                <li>Cigarette smoking is a co-factor associated with an increased incidence of cervix cancer. </li>
            </ul>
