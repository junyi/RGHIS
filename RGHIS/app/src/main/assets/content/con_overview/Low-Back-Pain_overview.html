            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Low back pain</strong> is very common. Fortunately, it is rarely life threatening. Most backaches are due to weakened and inflexible muscles and ligaments in the back, hips, thighs and abdomen.<br>
            <br>
            Our lower back supports most of our body weight, which therefore makes it more susceptible to injuries and other problems. </p>
