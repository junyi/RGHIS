            <p>The spine ( or backbone ) extends from the base of your skull to the buttocks. It consists of more than 20 separate called vertebrae stacked on top of one another. A flexible disc sits in between each pair of vertebrae. The vertebrae and discs are held together by ligaments. The spinal cord and the nerves run through the center of the spinal column.</p>
            <p>Most people suffer from mild <strong>back pain</strong> from time to time and the exact cause of which may be difficult to diagnose. It is usually a sign that one or more muscles, joints, ligaments or discs are over-stretched or twisted by movement of the back in an awkward position. Severe pain may be the result of pressure on nerves from the misalignment of the bones in the back and warrants immediate medical attention.<br>
            Low back pain afflicts some 80 % of the adult population some time or other in their lives. </p>
            <p>Many episodes of pain last only several hours or a day or two. By and large, 90% of patients should have recovered from their initial attack of pain by 6 weeks from the onset.</p>
