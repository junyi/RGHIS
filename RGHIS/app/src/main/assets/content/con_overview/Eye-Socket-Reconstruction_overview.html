<h1 class=sectionbanner>SOCKET RECONSTRUCTION</h2>
<p><em>Diseases or trauma may result in the loss of the eye, requiring the need for eye socket reconstruction.</em></p>
<h2>What is Eye Socket Reconstruction?<br>
 </h2>
Broadly speaking, eye socket reconstruction is the recreation of the normal eye appearance in patients who have diseased eyes that require removal of the eye. It involves volume replacement with a spherical implant and the subsequent wear of a customized prosthesis that looks like the other eye.<br>
 <br>
Patients who have had an eye enucleated or removed may have socket related problems including:<br>
 <br>
 Sensitivity to the ocular prosthesis (false eye)<br>
 Deep superior sulcus deformity ie the eye looks sunken above the upper eyelid<br>
 Shallow fornices ie the groove between the lids and the deeper tissues is too shallow to support an<br>
  ocular prosthesis<br>
 Contracted socket (a more severe deficiency of volume and surface area which makes retention of<br>
  an ocular prosthesis difficult)<br>
