            <p><strong>What is Prostate Cancer?<br>
            </strong><br>
            The prostate is a small gland located below the bladder and found only in men. It surrounds part of the urethra that allows the passage of urine from the bladder to the penis. The cells that make up the outermost part of the prostate can become cancerous and give rise to prostate cancer.</p>
