            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Trigeminal neuralgia (Facial Pain)</strong> is characterised by brief episodes of intense, stabbing, electric shock-like facial pain. These episodes occur spontaneously or can be triggered by light touch, chewing, or changes in temperature (i.e. cold). The pain is so intense as to be completely disabling. In addition, weight loss is common because oral triggers prevent affected individuals from eating enough to maintain adequate nutrition. <br>
            <br>
            A less common form of the disorder, called &quot;<strong>Atypical Trigeminal Neuralgia</strong>&quot;, may cause less intense, constant, dull burning or aching pain, sometimes with occasional electric shock-like stabs.</p>

            Causes </span></h2>
            <p>The cause of this condition is irritation of the fifth cranial nerve (the Trigeminal nerve) which is responsible for providing facial sensation. This irritation is occasionally due to benign tumours or multiple sclerosis, either of which can usually be detected by a high quality MRI of the brain. </p>
            <p>In the majority of cases, however, imaging of the brain does not reveal a cause of the nerve irritation. In such cases a small vessel (usually an artery but occasionally a vein) is often found at operation to be compressing the root entry zone of the Trigeminal nerve at the brainstem.</p>
