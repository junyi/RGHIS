<h2>Voiding Disorders in Women</h2>
<h2>What are voiding disorders?</h2>
<p>Voiding disorders are common in women. As many as 14% of women who present at the Urogynaecology Centre with bladder symptoms were found to have voiding disorders. It may be defined by an abnormally slow flow of urine during voiding, when the maximum urine flow rate is less than 15 ml per second, or a sensation of incomplete emptying of the bladder, when the residual urine volume is over 30 ml, within one minute post voiding.</p>

<h2>What are the complications that may arise?</h2>
<p>It is important to diagnose voiding disorders because if left unrecognised, it may predispose one to frequent urinary tract infections. In more severe case, the kidneys may be damaged by the continuous back pressure that is created by a full bladder.</p>
