<p><span style="color:#666666;line-height:18px">Pulpitis is an inflammation of the pulp. The pulp is a spongy soft tissue of nerves and blood vessels encased by tooth structure. In the crown, the enamel and dentine encases the pulp. When the integrity of the enamel and dentine is compromised eg through decay, the pulp is exposed to irritants. This provokes a response which you feel as a toothache.<br>
<br>
Pulpitis may be,
<ul>
    <li>Reversible  the pulp is able to heal if the irritation is removed eg by doing a filling in the case of decay         </li>
    <li>Irreversible  the pulp is unable to heal and requires pulp therapy or root canal treatment   </li>
</ul>
