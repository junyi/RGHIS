<h2>Travelling</h2>

<h2>Travelling With Your Child</h2>
<p>Travelling with a child presents unique challenges to every parent. You can make your next trip a more positive and enjoyable experience for the entire family if you adopt certain precautionary measures before and when you travel.</p>
<p>The Children's Travel Clinic offers you some tips on travel health especially when travelling with your child.</p>
<h2>Pre - Travel Advice</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Make an appointment with a doctor about 4 - 6 weeks before your departure to determine if vaccination is required for your destination. The doctor would also be able to determine your child's fitness level for travel. </li>
    <li>Vaccinations can help prevent the following diseases:
    <ul>
        <li>Typhoid </li>
        <li>Meningococcal Infection (caused by bacteria: Neisseria meningitidis) </li>
        <li>Influenza </li>
        <li>Hepatitis A and B </li>
        <li>Japanese B Encephalitis </li>
        <li>Yellow Fever </li>
        <li>Rabies </li>
        <li>Poliomyelitis </li>
        <li>Diphtheria </li>
        <li>Tetanus </li>
        <li>H. influenzae Type B </li>
        <li>Pneumococcal Infection (caused by bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae) </li>
        <li>Pertussis (whooping cough) </li>
        <li class=last>Varicella (chicken pox) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Obtain a letter from the doctor if your child has a medical condition and/or requires you to bring along medications when abroad.  </li>
    <li class=last>Pack a travel kit, which contains some first aid items such as antiseptics, dressing/bandages, sunscreen lotion, insect repellent, thermometer, fever medicine, oral re-hydration salts (for diarrhoea). Purchase medical/travel insurance. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Motion Sickness</h2>
<p>Motion sickness is a general term that includes car/sea/air sickness. It is a normal reaction to certain types of motion when you are travelling. Symptoms of motion sickness include nausea, vomiting, giddiness, turning pale and cold sweats.</p>

<p>Children are the most prone to motion sickness, which occurs more often on cars and buses than on planes/trains/ships.</p>
<p>Motion sickness tends to occur more commonly in children above 2 years old but improves when the child reaches 10 years old.</p>
<h3>To avoid motion sickness: </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Avoid full meals up to two hours before travelling. </li>
    <li>If possible, do not offer food to your child while in transit. If you must, choose easily digestible foods such as bread, juices or canned fruit. </li>
    <li>Discourage reading and colouring during the travel. Looking out of the window, engaging in travel games, playing with action figures or dolls are better diversions. </li>
    <li>Face forward when travelling and look up to the horizon. Sit on the front seat of the vehicle. For the child's safety, infants in rear-facing infant seats should not sit in the front passenger seat if the car has air-bags. </li>
    <li class=last>If your child is prone to severe motion sickness, approach your doctor who may prescribe medication to prevent such symptoms. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Jet Lag</h2>

<p>Jet lag is the feeling of being maladjusted in your biological clock with the new time zone. It comes from travelling by plane across time zones. Symptoms of jet lag include daytime fatigue, disturbed sleep patterns and gastrointestinal problems. </p>
<p>Travelling westward causes less jet lag than travelling eastward. Jet lag is usually less of a problem in children because they tend to adjust their nap and bedtime schedules more readily.</p>
<p>To reduce jet lag:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Rest well before long haul flight. </li>
    <li>Try to sleep on the plane especially if you are eastbound. </li>
    <li>Upon arrival at your travel destination, try to sleep at the night time of your new time zone and avoid day-time napping. </li>
    <li class=last>Do not plan a hectic schedule or a long drive on the first day of your arrival at your travel destination. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Tips for staying healthy when abroad </h2>

        <li class=last>If bitten by a snake, apply a pressure bandage and ice (if available), immobilise the affected limb and send the victim to a health centre as soon as possible. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
