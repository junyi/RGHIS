<h2>Obesity - Exercise</h2>
<h2>Managing Obesity Through Exercise</h2>
<p>Today, people generally view babies that are plump or chubby as &quot;cute&quot; or &quot;cuddly&quot;. They tend to associate these babies with feeding well and being healthy. However, if this chubbiness continues through childhood, it becomes less acceptable. While not all the overweight children go on to become overweight adults, obesity in adulthood has its origin in childhood.</p>
<h2>What Is Obesity?</h2>
<p>Obesity is defined as excess body fat in a person. There are many ways to quantify body fat and determine whether a child is obese. </p>
<p>In Singapore, the weight for height chart is the most commonly used tool to determine obesity.</p>
<p>In both adults and children, obesity is a major risk factor for chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnoea and osteoarthritis. Obese children also have difficulty establishing friendship, maintaining peer support and self-expression. In the long term, it is far more realistic to prevent children from becoming overweight than to treat the chronic illnesses that arise from obesity.</p>
<p>Understanding the causes of obesity is an important step in its prevention. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to childhood obesity.</p>

<h2>The Primary Causes Of Childhood Obesity Are Environmental In Nature </h2>
<p>An abundance of food allows for excessive intake of food from all food groups, especially fats. A diet high in fat is associated with increased prevalence of obesity. </p>
<p>As society becomes more affluent, the amount of incidental exercise reduces. Children no longer need to walk to school. They ride the school buses or are dropped off at the schools' doorstep by their parents. Instead of engaging in outdoor games, children spend more time in front of the television or computer. The excess calories consumed then leads to obesity.</p>
