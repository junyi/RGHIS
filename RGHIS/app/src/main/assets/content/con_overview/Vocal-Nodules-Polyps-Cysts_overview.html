            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes</span></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Nodules and polyps are usually due to repetitive trauma to the vocal folds e.g. due to frequent yelling or voice overuse. </li>
                <li>Reflux of acid from the stomach into the larynx (laryngopharyngeal reflux) and chronic exposure to irritants such as cigarette smoke may also contribute to formation of nodules and polyps. </li>
                <li>Cysts may occur on their own due to blockage of a mucous gland under the surface of the vocal fold Tumours of the vocal folds can also cause voice problems. </li>
                <li>Tumours are most commonly caused by smoking and alcohol. </li>
            </ul>
