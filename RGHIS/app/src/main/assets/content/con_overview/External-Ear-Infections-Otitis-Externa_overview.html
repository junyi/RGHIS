            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p>The ear is divided into three parts: the outer ear (the pinna and external ear canal), middle ear (behind the ear drum) and inner ear (cochlea). Infections of the outer and middle ear are much more common than inner ear infections. </p>
            <p><strong>Otitis Externa </strong></p>
            <p>An infection affecting the external ear canal is called otitis externa, commonly known as 'swimmers ear. Anyone can get otitis externa.</p>

            Causes</span></h2>
            <p>The skin of the ear canal is normally protected by a waxy, water-resistant coating. </p>
            <p><strong>Bacteria</strong> living on the surface of the skin can cause otitis externa when there is a break in the skins barrier. Trauma to the skin of the ear canal from cotton-tips or finger nails can result in a break in the barrier. Someone who swims frequently is also predisposed to external ear infection. Prolonged exposure to moisture results in the water-resistant coating and skin becoming soft, allowing bacteria to infect the skin. </p>
            <p><strong>High humidity</strong> in tropical countries, like Singapore, ups the risk for external ear infections. </p>
            <p><strong>Diabetics</strong> are at higher risk due to poor immunity. They are also more prone to an aggressive form of infection called malignant otitis externa, in which the infection involves the skull bone. </p>
