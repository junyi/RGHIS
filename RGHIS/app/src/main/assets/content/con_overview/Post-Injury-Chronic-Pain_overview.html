            <p><strong>What is post-injury chronic pain?</strong> <br>
            <br>
            After an injury such as a bruise, sprain or fracture of the arm or leg, complete healing and recovery occurs after a few weeks. In a small percentage of people, pain may persist at or around the injured site even though the skin or deeper tissues appear normal. This painful condition is called <strong>Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)</strong>. In some instances, the injury leading to CRPS may be so minor that patients sometimes cannot recall the injury or event that triggered CRPS. </p>
