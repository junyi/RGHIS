<h1 class=sectionbanner>LAZY EYE (AMBLYOPIA) </h2>
<p><em>Poor vision in only one eye due to a problem with sight development can lead to prolonged vision impairment in the affected eye, a condition called lazy eye.</em></p>
<h2>What is lazy eye (amblyopia)?</h2>
<p>Poor vision in one or both eyes caused by an impediment to normal visual development during childhood can lead to a lifelong condition called &quot;lazy eye&quot;. </p>

<h2>What causes lazy eye (amblyopia)?</h2>
<p>Lazy eye (amblyopia) is the poor vision due to incomplete visual development within the brain. The human brain requires visual stimulation to develop fully. Anything that interferes with clear vision in either eye between birth to 8 years of age can cause amblyopia. Common causes include presence of high spectacle power (eg. astigmatism, hyperopia and myopia), , or anything blocking the visual axis of one eye (eg. droopy eye lid, childhood ). Lazy eye (amblyopia) normally only affects one eye, but if both eyes are deprived of a good, clear visual images for sustained periods, the condition can arise in both eyes. Early diagnosis increases the chance of successful treatment, as after the age of 8 years, visual impairment may become permanent. Conversely, if your child does not have amblyopia by age 8 years, then he/she is unlikely to develop it. </p>

<h2>What puts my child at risk of lazy eye (amblyopia)?</h2>
<p>Your child is at a higher risk if he or she has:</p>
<p>- High amounts of astigmatism, long-sightedness (hyperopia) or short-sightedness (myopia)<br>
- Large differences in spectacle power between the two eyes<br>
- Obstruction of vision by congenital defects such as droopy eyelid (ptosis), cataracts or other<br>
  lesions in the eye<br>
- Strabismus or squints where the eye that is misaligned is not used </p>
