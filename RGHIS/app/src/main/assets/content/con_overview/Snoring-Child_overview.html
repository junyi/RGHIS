<h2>Snoring</h2>
<h2>Does Your Child Snore?</h2>
<p>Researchers have found that 20% of normal children snore occasionally and 7-10% have habitual snoring. In many cases, children who snore are perfectly healthy. About 1% of children snore because they suffer from sleep and breathing problems. The risk is higher if they have a known predisposing factor e.g. large tonsils and adenoids, obesity, nerve and muscle problems, abnormality in the jaw and face area or a family history of sleep and breathing problems. You should be aware of your child's sleep and snoring patterns and visit a sleep specialist if you suspect something out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>Children who struggle to breathe while snoring may be suffering from Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypoventilation Syndrome (OSAHS). These children may snort or gasp as they snore, and may appear to &quot;suck in the chest&quot;. OSAHS is described as breathing that starts and stops during sleep. The stoppage is usually caused when the throat narrows or even closes during sleep.</p>
