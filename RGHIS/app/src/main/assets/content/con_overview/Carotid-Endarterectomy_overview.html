            <p>In Singapore, <strong>stroke</strong> is the 4th leading cause of death and a major contributor to long term disability. A stroke or &quot;brain attack&quot; can occur when one of the major arteries in the neck (the carotid artery) is narrowed by fatty deposits (plaques). Such &quot;hardening&quot; of the carotid artery can lead to damage to part of the brain, either as a consequence of reduced blood flow or because small pieces of &quot;emboli&quot; break off from the plaque and lodge into arteries in the brain or eye. This ultimately results in an ischaemic type of stroke, which accounts for 75% of all strokes. <strong>Carotid endarterectomy (CEA)</strong> is a surgical procedure performed to reduce the risk of stroke. <strong>It can therefore help prevent an ischaemic stroke in certain patients with carotid artery stenosis.</strong></p>
            <p>This procedure does not apply to haemorrhagic strokes (bleeding in the brain), which make up the other 25% of strokes.</p>
