            </strong><br>
            Sarcomas are rare but aggressive tumours arise from a primitive tissue subtype known as mesoderm, and can thus affect a very wide variety of tissues and organs in the body across a wide range of age groups, from young children to the elderly. Sarcomas generally arise from soft tissue or bony sites on the body, giving rise to the broad division into soft tissue and bony sarcomas. More than 30 different subtypes of sarcomas have been described.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>How common is Sarcoma?</strong><br>
            <br>
            These are relatively rare cancers that comprise 1% of all malignancies. The National Cancer Centre sees approximately 60 cases of sarcoma in year 2013.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Age of Onset</strong><br>
            <br>
            Different subtypes of sarcoma affect patients from different age groups; no one particular age group is more commonly afflicted with all sarcoma subtypes.</p>


            <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Causes and Risks</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">For most patients, no risk factors have been identified.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">Patients with familial diseases such as neurofibromatosis who have multiple benign enlargements of nerve sheaths have a higher risk of one of these enlarged nerve sheaths turning cancerous.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">Patients with prior radiotherapy have a slightly higher chance of developing a sarcoma within the previously radiated area. This may take up to 10 years to occur.</p>
