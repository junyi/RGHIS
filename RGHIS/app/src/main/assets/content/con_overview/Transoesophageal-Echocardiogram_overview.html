            <p>Transoesophagael echocardiogram (TEE) is a diagnostic procedure similar to the echocardiogram which you might have undergone previously. Unlike the standard echocardiogram, a transducer is mounted onto the tip of a long and slim endoscope called the TEE probe. This TEE probe will be introduced into your oesophagus or throat. The pictures obtained will provide useful information to your doctor to help in the management of your condition.</p>

                        <p>Before the procedure starts, a doctor will need you to sign an informed consent and ask you a few routine questions to rule out any contraindications to the procedure, ie whether it is advisable for you to undergo the test. Thereafter, the doctor will insert a cannula into the vein of your hand to facilitate injection of medication (eg. sedatives). A local anaesthesia (lignocaine) will be sprayed on the back of your throat so that the doctor an test your throat for gagging reflex. You will then be asked to lie on your side and a mouthpiece will be placed between your teeth to prevent you from biting the TEE probe accidentally.</p>
                        <p>When the TEE probe is introduced into your throat, you may experience some discomfort. This discomfort may be minimised by swallowing and the doctor will let you know when to do it. You are advised to relax and breathe normally through the nose. Please do not swallow when saliva accumulates in your mouth. A container will be provided to collect the saliva.</p>

            After the examination, you are required to rest in the laboratory for another 30 minutes if sedatives were administered. You are advised to inform the doctor if you experience any pain or unusual discomfort in the chest or throat. You may eat or drink only after the anaesthetic effects have worn off, usually an hour later.<br>

            <p>As this is a semi-invasive procedure, it carries a very small risk of complications similar to that of endoscopy or gastroscopy (endoscopic examination of the food passage or stomach done by the gastroenterologist). <br>
            <br>
            Major complications from this test are very rare. Qualified and specially trained doctors will perform this procedure. You may experience a slight sore throat after the procedure. </p>
