<p><strong><span style="line-height:18px;color:#00cccc">A 'cleft' is a gap, which can occur in the lip or palate (roof of the mouth) or both.</span></strong><br>
<span style="color:#666666;line-height:18px">The cleft lip may be as minor as a notch in the upper lip or as extensive as a wide fissure extending through the lip and gum (alveolar ridge) into the nose. The cleft may occur on one side of the lip (unilateral cleft lip) or on both sides of the lip (bilateral cleft lip). A cleft palate may occur in combination with a unilateral or bilateral cleft of the lip or it may occur with a completely normal lip.<br>
