            <p>A small tube called the catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in your groin/ wrist/ arm and guided to your heart. A special contrast is then injected from the catheter into the heart arteries making the vessel visible on the X-ray. The images are then recorded by X-ray film, making a motion picture of the heart and blood vessels. </p>
