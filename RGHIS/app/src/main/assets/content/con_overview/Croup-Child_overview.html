    <h2><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='2'>Causes</font></font></h2>

    <p><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='2'>Croup is a viral infection
    of the vocal cords, voice box (larynx) and windpipe (trachea). It is usually part of
    a cold. Swelling of the vocal cords cause hoarseness. All children with croup have a
    tight, low-pitched "barking" cough.</font></font></p>

    <p><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='2'>Stridor occurs as the
    opening between the vocal cords becomes narrower. Stridor is a harsh, raspy vibrating
    sound when your child breathes, and is usually present only with crying or coughing.
    As the disease becomes worse, stridor also occurs when he is sleeping or
    relaxed.</font></font></p>

    <h2><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='2'>Expected
    Course</font></font></h2>

    <p><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='2'>Croup usually lasts for 5
    - 6 days and generally gets worse at night. The symptoms are usually worse in
    children under 3 years of age.</font></font></p>
