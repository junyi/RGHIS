<h2>What Is Asthma?</h2>
<p>Bronchial Asthma is a common problem in childhood. It affects about 20% of the children in Singapore. Parents are usually anxious and worried when told that their child has bronchial asthma. However, if one understands the nature of the condition, one can be reassured that the asthmatic child can remain healthy and physically active despite the problem.</p>
<p>Asthma is a condition whereby there is chronic inflammation of the airways. The inflamed airways are more sensitive than normal. No one knows for sure why some people get asthma. However, we do know that when the sensitive airways are exposed to a trigger factor, it over-reacts by releasing chemicals that result in the airways becoming narrowed.</p>
<p>This narrowing is due to 2 factors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The muscles around the airways contract or tighten, making the air passage narrow </li>
    <li class=last>The lining of the airways swells or becomes inflamed and produces excessive mucus secretions which may plug up the airways. Airway inflammation is present all the time, especially in children with chronic symptoms. </li>
</ul>
