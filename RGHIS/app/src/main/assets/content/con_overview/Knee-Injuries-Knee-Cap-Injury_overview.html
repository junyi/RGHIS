            Causes</span></h2>
            <p>Structural alignment and muscle weakness or imbalance may cause the patella (kneecap) to track improperly on the femur (tight bone) during movement. This results in excessive wear and teaar on the undersurface of the kneecap in contact with the tight bone leading to pain around the kneecap</p>
