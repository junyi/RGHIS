<h2>Sacrospinous Fixation</h2>
<h2>What Is A Sacrospinous Fixation?</h2>
<p>It is an operation that is performed through the vaginal route to support the vagina (after previous surgery to remove the womb) by attaching the top of it to the right sacrospinous ligament.</p>
<p>It is often not the only procedure that is done. It may be done concurrently with surgery to correct urinary incontinence, to remove the womb or to correct bladder or rectal prolapse in the vagina.</p>
<h2>Why Is It Performed?</h2>
<p>It is performed for severe protrusion of the vagina (after the womb was removed surgically).</p>
<p>The protrusion can bother you because of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A heavy dragging, sometimes painful sensation in the vagina </li>
    <li>An uncomfortable lump that can be felt or seen </li>
    <li>Urinary difficulties (e.g. incomplete emptying of the bladder) </li>
    <li>Bowel difficulties (e.g. constipation, incomplete emptying of the bowels) </li>
    <li>Pain </li>
    <li>Infection </li>
    <li class=last>Bleeding </li>
</ul>
<p>The objective of the operation is to relieve the symptoms, restore vaginal anatomy and sexual function.</p>
