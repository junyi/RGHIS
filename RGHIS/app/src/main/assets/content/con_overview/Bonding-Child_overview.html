<h2>Bonding</h2>
<h2>Bonding With Your Child</h2>
<p><em>By Department of Child Development and Psychology Service, KK Women's and Children's Hospital </em></p>
<p>Parenthood is often described as a wonderful and unique experience where most parents seek to enjoy a close relationship with their child. Yet, parenthood is also known to be full of ups and downs, accompanied with all kinds of conflicting emotions and experiences. As such, parenthood can perhaps be described as one of the most wonderful, difficult, rewarding, thankless, exciting, terrifying, satisfying, amazing experience on earth. To add to this unique experience of being parents, there is also the presence of juggling work related stressors/schedules by most working parents that make bonding with our child more challenging. Nevertheless, research has suggested some basic tips that working parents may likely find helpful.</p>
<h2>Here are some tips to consider:</h2>
<p>The 7Ps to foster a closer relationship and bond with your child</p>
<ol class=contentpage>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px"><strong>Parent-Child Communication</strong>: Instead of talking at or about your child, talk with your child. Bring yourself to his level. If you want to understand what your child is thinking or feeling, ask him and listen. Do not pass judgement on what he tells you. Acknowledge his ideas and feelings even if you disagree with him. You can also share with your child your opinions and feelings. In addition, you need to constantly reassure your child of your love for him through verbal expressions such as &quot;I love you&quot; and non-verbal gestures like a kiss, hug or a pat on the shoulder. </span></li>
    <p> </p>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px"><strong>Praise Your Child &amp; Be Specific: </strong>Praise your child when he does something well or when he puts in effort. Praise him for improvements made or for behaviours that you want to see again. Also, it is helpful to note that praises are to be conveyed in a sincere manner. Use them to describe specifically to your child what you like about his work or behaviour. Instead of just saying &quot;nice drawing&quot;, you may say, &quot;I like the colours that you used in this painting. They make your painting really outstanding!&quot; Instead of just saying &quot;Good girl&quot;, you may say, &quot;I am happy that you have tidied up your room. It looks very neat.&quot; This clearly communicates to your child the positive behaviour you appreciate. </span></li>
    <p> </p>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px"><strong>Put Aside Time For Your Child: </strong>Put aside time for your child everyday. When you are with your child, be really involved. Put aside your household chores, newspapers or worries during this time. Letting your child know that you enjoy being with him will definitely draw both of you closer. Make other arrangements if you are unable to spend time with him for that particular day. For example, call him from work for a five-minute chat to show that you are thinking of him. Or if you are unable to have dinner together, have dessert together later in the night. Once in a while, take an entire day or half day off from your busy schedule and do something special with your child. Choose something that both you and your child will enjoy and which is not an everyday activity. For example, taking a walk in the nature reserve and having lunch that both of you had prepared in the morning. </span></li>
    <p> </p>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px"><strong>Play With Your Child: </strong>The time you spend with your child gives you the opportunity to understand him better and to build a positive and healthy relationship with him. This relationship will develop as your child matures. Playing with your child does not necessarily require expensive toys. You can think of childhood games that you enjoyed and teach your child how to play them. </span></li>
    <p> </p>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px"><strong>Pay Attention To Your Child's Feelings: </strong>By paying attention to and talking about his feelings, you are sending messages to your child that you really want to understand him. Also, your childs daily experiences will generate a whole range of feelings in him. For example, he could be happy because he was praised by his teacher or upset because he just had a quarrel with his close friend. Find out what is happening to your child and pay attention to his feelings, positive and negative, towards these experiences. Listen to your child and talk to him about his feelings. For example, you may say, &quot;From what you've told me, it sounds like you're angry with John for talking behind your back.&quot; Give him a chance to clarify his feelings. </span></li>
    <p> </p>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px"><strong>Foster Your Child's Independence: </strong>Many parents try to get closer to their child by holding on too tightly. Give your child the freedom to explore the world in a manner appropriate for their age. This will provide him/her with the opportunities to develop age appropriate skills and build up his/her self-confidence. By giving your child due freedom and providing security at home, you are bridging the gap between you and your child. </span></li>
    <p> </p>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px"><strong>Solve Problems With Your Child: </strong>When your child encounters problems, you need not provide the solution all the time nor tell him what he should do. Neither do you want to leave him to deal with the problem by himself. Be your child's partner in problem-solving. Listen and understand the situation. Next, find out how your child thinks or feels about it and what he can do. Provide other options if you can. Help your child think of possible consequences to each option. Together, you and your child can then decide on the best solution. Solving problems with your child not only teaches him an important life skill, it also develops a strong bond between you and your child as both of you conquer each problem together. </span></li>
