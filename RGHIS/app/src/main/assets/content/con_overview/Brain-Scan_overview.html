            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Procedure</span></h2>
            <p>An injection containing a small amount of radioactive tracer will be given and scanning can commence about 10 minutes later. You will be asked to lie down on a couch and your head will be strapped to keep it from moving during the procedure. The whole procedure will take about 45 minutes to an hour. You will be conscious at all times but in certain cases, sedation would have to be given.<br>

            <strong>Patient Preparation<br>
            </strong><br>
            Generally there is no need to prepare for the procedure except for epilepsy studies which are done in conjunction with video EEG (brain wave) monitoring.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Special Procedure<br>
            <br>
            </strong>Cisternography is a different type of scan, which looks at the flow pattern of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around or in the brain. This procedure can also tell us if there is any leakage of the CSF. The tracer is injected into the lower back region by the Nuclear Medicine physician. After the injection, you will have to lie down on a couch for a few hours. Images of your CSF will be taken at regular intervals and it can take up to two or three days to complete the procedure.</p>
