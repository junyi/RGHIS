<h2>Intrauterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD)</h2>
<h2>What Is An IUCD*?</h2>
<p>An Intrauterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD) is a device which is inserted into the uterus (womb) to prevent pregnancy. There are many types of IUCDs and they come in different shapes and sizes. Commonly used types are IUCDs containing copper.</p>
<p><em>*IUCD is also commonly known as 'IUD'.</em></p>
<h2>How Does An IUCD Prevent Pregnancy?</h2>
<p>The IUCD works by changing the uterine lining and preventing the fertilised egg from getting attached to the wall of the womb, therefore preventing implantation.</p>
