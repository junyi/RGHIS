            <p><strong>Brain Tumour</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A brain tumour is an abnormal growth of cells present from the brain or its nerves or its coverings </li>
                <li>It can arise from cells inside the brain / nerves /brain coverings, and can be cancerous or noncancerous </li>
                <li>It can also a cancerous growth that has spread to the brain from a cancer present in another part of the body </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tumour Biopsy</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In some brain cancer cases, removal of some tumour tissue (biopsy) to confirm its nature and its suitability for further treatment (radiation therapy, chemotherapy) may be all that can be done </li>
                <li>This biopsy is done with MRI-guidance using a special metal frame (frame-based) or a computerized neuronavigation system (frameless) </li>
                <li>It can be done under Local or General anaesthesia </li>
                <li>A small scalp incision is needed </li>
                <li>A small opening, the size of a 10 cent coin, is made in the skull bone </li>
                <li>A biopsy needle is inserted to take out samples of the brain tumour tissue </li>
            </ul>
