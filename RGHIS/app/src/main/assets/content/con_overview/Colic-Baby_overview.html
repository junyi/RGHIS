            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Colic</strong> is the uncontrollable crying of a baby for hours with no known reason. Your baby may have colic if he or she cries excessively over several days. Although the crying can happen any time, it usually gets worse in the late afternoon and evening. </p>
            <p><strong>Colic</strong> usually appears in the first few weeks after birth and lasts for three to four months. Although it is upsetting for parents and other caregivers, colic is normal. Babies at six to eight weeks old usually have the worst colic. The condition goes away on its own when the baby is between eight and 14 weeks old. </p>
            <p>The main problem with colic is that it creates stress and anxiety at home. Take comfort in the fact that colic is normal and temporary. It is common to feel scared, upset or frustrated when you cannot get your baby to stop crying. But your baby will grow out of it.You may find it difficult to cope with the constant crying, so it's important for you to have support and to take a break now and then.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes </span></h2>
            <p>Doctors are not sure what causes colic. But it is thought that a baby's sensitive temperament and its undeveloped nervous system could be the reasons. These two factors may make a baby cry easily and have trouble stopping. </p>
            <p>As babies grow, they are better able to control their crying. Colic is not related to health conditions, such as problem in digesting. But having gas in the belly can make crying worse. Colic is not caused by pain or illness. If you think your baby is crying because he or she is hurt or sick, call your doctor. </p>
            <p>Colic is not your fault or your baby's fault. It doesn't mean that you are a bad parent or that anything is wrong with your baby. Babies with colic continue to eat and gain weight normally. If your baby doesn't eat normally, you should see your doctor.</p>
