<p class="p2"><b>What is Lung Cancer?<br>
</b><br>
Lung Cancer is cancer that starts in the lungs. The lungs are located in the chest. They help you breathe. When you breathe, air goes through your nose, down your windpipe (trachea), and into the lungs, where it spreads through tubes called bronchi. Most lung cancer begins in the cells that line these tubes (bronchi). <br>
<br>
The two main types of lung cancer are:<br>
- Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) which is the most common type of lung cancer.<br>
- Small cell lung cancer makes up about 10% of all lung cancer cases.<br>
<br>
These types are diagnosed based on how the cells look under a microscope.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>How common is Lung Cancer?</b><br>
<br>
Lung cancer is the numberÂ 1 killer in males and 2nd in females in Singapore. Between 2009 and 2013, there was an average of 1311 people in Singapore diagnosed with lung cancer yearly. The great majority were smokers. The risk of lung cancer in a smoker is 15 to 25 times more than for a non-smoker. More recently, we have increasingly recognized a group of lung cancer in patients who have never smoked, and a proportion of cases are related to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutations.<br>

Age of Onset</b><br>
<br>
Most persons diagnosed with lung cancer are older than 40 years of age. However, the disease may begin before this age range.</p>

Causes and Risks</b></h2>
<p class="p2">Cigarette smoking is the main cause of lung cancer. It is responsible for more than 90% of the cases of lung cancers. The risk of lung cancer is greater with the increased number of years of smoking and the increased number of cigarettes smoked per day. Pipe, cigar and marijuana smoking also increase the risk of lung cancer. Spouses of smokers have a 35% higher risk of developing lung cancer compared to spouses of non-smoking persons. The risk to children of smokers is not yet accurately identified.<br>
<br>
Exposure to certain workplace chemicals such as asbestos, coal gas, chromium, nickel, arsenic, vinyl chloride, and mustard gas increases the risk of lung cancer.</p>
