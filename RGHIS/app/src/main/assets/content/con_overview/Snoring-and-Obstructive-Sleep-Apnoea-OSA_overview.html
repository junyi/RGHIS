            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Sleep-disordered breathing (SBD)</strong> is used to describe snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) syndrome. Snoring and OSA are common medical conditions that affect between 15-50% of the adult population worldwide. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Snoring,</strong> due to vibration of tissues in the throat, can be a symptom of partial upper airway obstruction. The partial obstruction can lead to complete airway obstruction  a medical condition called obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). In Singapore, about 15% of adults have OSA. <br>

            </span></strong>Consequences Studies have shown that OSA presents a huge economic burden to society. Individuals with untreated OSA use more healthcare resources, are associated with poor work performances and occupational injuries and are involved in more traffic accidents.<br>
             <br>
            Studies have also shown that compared to normal individuals, untreated and inadequately treated OSA can lead to increased risk of : </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes</span></h2>
            <p>Individuals with OSA have a narrower upper airway and repeated upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to poor sleep quality, sleep deprivation and cardiovascular abnormalities that put tremendous stress on the heart and body. The upper airway obstruction leads to decreased oxygen supply to the brain, heart and other organs, causing the heart to work harder to provide oxygen to the tissues, leading to medical consequences in the long run.</p>
