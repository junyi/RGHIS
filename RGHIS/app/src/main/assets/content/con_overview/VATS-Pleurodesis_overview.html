            <p>Spontaneous pneumothorax may occur in young patients. This condition is usually due to a tiny anomaly called a bleb in the lung which might have leaked during strenuous exercises. This results in air in the chest cavity, causing the lung to collapse. This is potentially dangerous whereby shortness of breath or chest pain is presented. When this condition happens again, it is known as recurrent pneumothorax. In such situations, surgery is advised. <strong>VATS pleurodesis</strong> is performed via three 10mm ports. The anomaly is removed and lung is made to adhere to the pleural lining, preventing pneumothorax from recurring.</p>
