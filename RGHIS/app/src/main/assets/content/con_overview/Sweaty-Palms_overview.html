            <p><strong>What are Sweaty Palms (Palmar Hyperhidrosis)?</strong></p>
            <p>Sweaty palms (Palmar hyperhidrosis) is a physical condition with uncontrollable excessive hand sweating. It may cause severe psychological, social and/or professional disability. Problems such as difficulties handling paper, pens, buttons, tools, electronic equipment, as well as the need to avoid handshakes force many people to seek treatment. </p>
            <p>The pathophysiological cause for the excessive sweating is still unknown but the condition is related to over-activity in the so-called 'sympathetic nervous system', a system of nerves over which we have no control. Emotional stimuli seem to have a stronger effect on the sweat glands in certain individuals. </p>
