            <p>The Nuclear Cardiology Test allows us to access the function and blood flow of your heart at rest or during exercise by injecting a tracer followed by taking images with a special camera (Gamma Camera). These tests can help the doctor to decide if the patient needs further treatment or surgery.</p>

            <p>On the day of the test, please wear comfortable clothing and footwear for walking on a treadmill machine.</p>
            <p>For male patients, it may be necessary to shave your chest before the test to allow for attachment of the ECG electrodes. This can be done at the National Heart Centre Singapore by our nurse, or you may prefer to do this yourself before coming for the test.</p>
            <p>No coffee, tea or cola on the day of the test.</p>

            <p>You will be given an injection, after which radiographic images will be taken. It is important to keep still (except for normal breathing movements) during the imaging which lasts about 15-20 minutes. The whole procedure will take about 3 hours including the exercise. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Separate Day Rest</strong></p>
            <p>For tests done without stress testing, you may have to stay up to 2-3 hours at the National Heart Centre Singapore.</p>
            <p>For tests done with stress testing, you may have to stay up to 3 hours at the Centre. In addition to the imaging done with the stress test, a second imaging at rest may be required for comparison. In such cases, arrangements will be made for you to come back later in the day or on another day.</p>

            <p>Yes. Although there is some radiation during the test, the amount is well within the accepted safety levels. For tests done with stress testing, your heart rate, blood pressure and electrocardiogram (ECG) will be monitored closely by a cardiologist during the test. However, you cannot take this test if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Please let the doctor know if you are breast-feeding or if there is any possibility that you are pregnant. </p>

            <p>If you are having flu with fever, infectious diseases such as sore eye or chicken pox, feeling lethargic or may be pregnant, you should not undergo the nuclear cardiology test. Before the test, you will be examined by a doctor to ensure that you are fit for it.</p>
