            <p><strong>What is radiofrequency lesioning?</strong></p>
            <p>Radiofrequency lesioning is a procedure that uses a radiofrequency current to produce heat to disrupt nerves that carry pain signals to the brain. More than one area may need to be treated to achieve optimal pain relief.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Procedure</span></h2>
            <p><strong>When is radiofrequency lesioning performed?</strong></p>
            <p>Radiofrequency lesioning is usually performed after you have good response to a nerve block procedure. For example, if you have significant pain relief after a facet joint injection, your pain specialist may recommend that you undergo a radiofrequency lesioning procedure. This procedure may give you a longer duration of pain relief.</p>
            <p><strong>What are some painful conditions that may be treated with radiofrequency lesioning?</strong></p>
            <p>Common painful conditions that may respond to radiofrequency lesioning include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Facet joint pain of the spine (neck or back) </li>
                <li>Sacroiliac joint pain </li>
                <li>Facial pain (e.g. trigeminal neuralgia) </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Discuss with your pain specialist whether radiofrequency lesioning is a viable option for your pain condition. He or she will be able to advise you.</p>
            <p><strong>How long does pain relief last after radiofrequency lesioning?</strong></p>
            <p>Pain relief usually lasts for 3-24 months. Results may vary depending on the individual. It should provide you the pain relief you need to resume your daily activities.</p>
            <p>Your body may regenerate the nerves responsible for sending pain signals to your brain. If this occurs, radiofrequency lesioning treatment can be performed again. </p>
            <p><strong>Is the procedure painful?</strong></p>
            <p>This procedure is not particularly painful. A local anaesthetic is used to numb the skin before the radiofrequency needle is inserted. Your pain specialist may also give you a sedative to reduce discomfort during the treatment. The procedure takes approximately 30-45 minutes. </p>
            <p><strong>Is there pain after the radiofrequency lesioning?</strong></p>
            <p>You may experience some discomfort at the site of injection on the first 1-2 days after the procedure. Painkillers can be prescribed for you during this short period of time. The discomfort usually subsides after 3 days.</p>
