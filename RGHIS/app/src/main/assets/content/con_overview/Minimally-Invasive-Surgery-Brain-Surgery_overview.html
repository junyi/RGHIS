            <p><strong>Minimally Invasive Surgery in Neurosurgery</strong> can be used to diagnose and treat neurological conditions such as ,  (abnormal buildup of fluid in the brain) and movement disorders such as .<br>

            <strong>Traditional brain surgery requires removing part of the skull to allow access to the brain. In contrast, minimally invasive surgery usually involves making tiny incisions, e.g. 1 or 2 cm holes.</strong> Through these incisions, instruments with tiny video cameras are inserted, giving the surgeons an inside view and enabling surgical access to the affected areas of the brain.<br>

            With real time intra-operative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (iMRI) and Computed Tomography (iCT) scanning, and advanced image-guidance navigation system capabilities, surgeons are able to monitor the patients progress and perform more complicated surgeries with greater accuracy and improved patient outcomes.</p>
