            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes </span></h2>
            <p>What causes allergies is not exactly known. Allergies tend to run in families so if either parent has an allergy, the child has a higher chance of getting allergies. However, some children have allergies even if no one in the family does. There is usually a history of contact with an allergen, which is a substance that can be eaten, inhaled, injected or come into contact with the skin. Common allergens include peanuts, pollen, medicines, insect stings and animal dander.</p>
