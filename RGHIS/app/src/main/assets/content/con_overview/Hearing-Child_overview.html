<h2>Your Childs Hearing</h2>
<p>The following information has been prepared to help you monitor behavioural responses of your childs hearing ability. The checklist indicates behaviours that are age appropriate for the detection of hearing loss.</p>
<p>In addition, a list of what you can do to help your child learn to speak and to use his/her hearing is also included.</p>
<p>If your child fails to respond as the checklist suggests, there may be problems that require further evaluation. You may wish to discuss this with you pediatrician, who will then refer you to an ENT (ear, nose and throat) Specialist, as well as an Audiologist for further investigation.</p>
<h2>Checklist for Speech and Hearing</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>3  6 months:</strong> Your child should awaken or quieten to the sound of your voice. He/She will typically turn his/her eyes towards the direction of the sound source. Your child should also be able to react to loud sounds, begin to repeat sounds e.g. ahh and imitate his/her own voice. </li>
    <li><strong>7 - 10 months:</strong> Your child should be able to turn his/her head and shoulders towards familiar sounds, even when he/she cannot see what is happening. Sounds do not have to be loud to cause him/her to respond. Your child should also be able to respond to his/her own name, start to respond to requests such as 'come here and look at things and pictures when someone talks about them. </li>
    <li><strong>11 - 15 months:</strong>Your child should show understanding of some words by appropriate behaviour. For example, he/she should be able to point to or look at familiar objects on request. He/She may jabber in response to a voice, and may cry when there is loud thunder or may frown when being scolded. </li>
    <li><strong>18 months:</strong>Some children begin to identify parts of the body. They should be able to point to their eyes or nose on request. They should be using a few words, such as 'bye-bye. The words may not be complete or pronounced perfectly, but are clearly meaningful. The child should also be able to respond to simple yes-no questions. </li>
    <li><strong>2 years:</strong> Your child should be able to follow a few simple commands without visual cues. He/She should be using a variety of everyday words heard at home. Children of this age enjoy being read to and shown simple pictures in a book, and will point them out when asked. Your childs knowledge of action words should also increase by this stage. </li>
    <li><strong>2Р’Р… years:</strong>Your child should be able to recite or sing short rhymes or songs and enjoy listening to tapes or watching cartoons. If your child has good hearing, these songs would make them happy, and he/she would usually react to the sound by running to look at or by telling someone what they hear. </li>
    <li><strong>3 years:</strong> Your child should be able to understand and use some simple verbs (such as 'go), prepositions (such as 'in or 'on), adjectives (such as 'big/small) and pronouns (such as 'I/you). He/She should be able to locate the source of the sound and be able to use complete sentences some of the time. </li>
    <li><strong>4 years:</strong> Your child should be able to give connected accounts of a recent experience or event. He/She should be able to carry out a sequence of two simple directions (such as 'Take the ball and give it to mummy). </li>
    <li class=last><strong>5 years:</strong> Your childs speech should be understandable, even though at time they may be mispronounced. Most children by this age can carry on a conversation, if the vocabulary is within their experience. </li>
</ul>
