            <p><strong>What is Pancreas Cancer?<br>
            </strong><br>
            The pancreas is an organ lying between the stomach, liver and intestine. It is made of 2 types of glands. One type of gland tissue produces insulin and other hormones. Cancers of the glands in the pancreas are uncommon cancers. They are called by various names, depending on the specific type of cancer cell or by the hormone produced by the cancer. Names include carcinoid tumour, islet cell carcinoma, insulinoma, glucagonoma, and so forth. These are not covered in this website because of rarity. The other type of gland tissue produces enzymes which help in digestion of food. These glands drain into ducts which in turn drain into the small intestine. It is the cells of the ducts which can turn into cancer. These are more common pancreas cancers, usually of the type called adenocarcinoma.</p>
            <p><strong>How common is Pancreas Cancer?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Although pancreatic cancer is common in the United States and accounts for the 4th most common cause of cancer death there, pancreatic cancer is not as common here in Singapore.</p>
            <p><strong>Age of Onset</strong><br>
            <br>
            The incidence of pancreatic cancer increases with age. The vast majority of patients are aged between 50 and 80 years of age.</p>
