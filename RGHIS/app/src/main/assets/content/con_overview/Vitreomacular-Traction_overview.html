<h1 class=sectionbanner>VITREOMACULAR TRACTION</h2>
<em>When the gel-like fluid in the eye gets weaker, it can pull on the light-sensitive retina, causing vision problems like fuzzy sight and distorted images.</em><br>

<h2>What is a Vitreomacular Traction?<br>
  </h2>
Vitreomacular traction is a condition in which the vitreous <br>
-- the gel-like substance in the eye  pulls abnormally on <br>
the , the light-sensitive innermost layer of the eye<br>
that is responsible to processing visual images. When the<br>
pulling of the gel distortsthe retina, it causes swelling and <br>
decreased vision.      <br>

<h2>What causes Vitreomacular Traction?<br>
 </h2>
When one ages, the gel-like vitreous in the eye usually becomes more liquefied, causing it to pull on the retina. This pulling (or traction), causes wrinkling of the retinal surface or distortion of the retinal blood vessels, which lead to vision loss. <br>
