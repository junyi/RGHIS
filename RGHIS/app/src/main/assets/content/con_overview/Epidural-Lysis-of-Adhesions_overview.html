            <p><strong><em>What is epidural lysis of adhesions?</em></strong></p>
            <p>The epidural space is a thin area between the inside of the spine and the protective layer around the spinal cord. Scars or adhesions may form in the epidural space after an injury or back surgery. These adhesions can restrict the movement of nerves and cause nerve compression or irritation. If you have symptoms such as <strong>low back pain</strong> or pain shooting into your arms or legs, you may have nerve irritation secondary to epidural adhesions. Epidural lysis of adhesions is designed to release the tension on the nerves by reducing inflammation and dissipating scar tissues surrounding the nerves.</p>
