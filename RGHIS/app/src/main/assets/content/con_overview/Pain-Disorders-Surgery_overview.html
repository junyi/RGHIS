            <p><strong>What Is Pain? </strong></p>
            <p>Pain has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as 'an unpleasant sensory or emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage.' Chronic pain is one of the most prevalent physical complaints and is loosely defined as prolonged pain of at least three months duration. Epidemiological research has estimated that 10-20% of the adult population suffers from chronic pain. The American Academy of Pain Management reported that greater than 50% of all Americans experienced recurrent or chronic pain in the past year. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes </span></h2>
            <p>Pain serves as a protective mechanism by warning us that something is not right with our bodies and prompts us to stay away from harm. Acute pain lasts for only a short duration. However, chronic pain occurs when this protective mechanism converts this normal warning sign into an unpleasant and intolerable disease. <br>
            <br>
            Chronic pain can range from mild to severe, episodic or constant, merely inconvenient or completely incapacitating. Although the cause is not completely understood, in chronic pain, signals of pain remain active in the nervous system for weeks, months, or even years. This can result in physical and emotional stress on a person. </p>
