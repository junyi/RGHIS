            <p>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection that occurs when bacteria gain access into the urinary system, i.e. the bladder and the kidneys. UTI is one of the most common bacterial infections in children and requires prompt recognition, treatment and investigations.</p>

            Causes</span></h2>
            <p>UTI is usually caused by bacteria commonly found in the stools, which can stay on the skin around the buttock areas. The bacteria can gain access into the urethra which is the passage leading to the bladder from outside the body and along which urine passes. Why UTI occurs in a child is not fully understood but it is not entirely due to poor cleaning or inadequate changing of diapers. In some children, an underlying abnormality of the urinary tract can predispose them to UTI.</p>
