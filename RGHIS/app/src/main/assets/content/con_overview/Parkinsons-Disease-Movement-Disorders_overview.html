            <p>Parkinsons disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimers disease. A study in Singapore showed that Parkinsons disease occurs as commonly as in the West. Three out of every thousand individuals, aged 50 years and above, have this disease. As Singapores population continues to age, the number of people with Parkinsons disease and movement disorders, such as essential tremor, dystonia, chorea and myoclonus will rise. As with many other medical conditions, these diseases currently do not have a cure. However, there are effective treatments available to control symptoms and improve daily function. Minimally invasive surgery is also available to treat patients with advanced disease. The Parkinsons Disease and Movement Disorders Programme emphasises the provision of comprehensive clinical services coupled with strong research initiatives. A multi-disciplinary team of neurologists, neurosurgeons, nurse clinicians, therapists and medical social workers, work together to provide the best care for our patients. </p>

This may refer to conditions that slow down body movements such as Parkinsons disease or conditions that are associated with abnormal or increased body movements. The disorders we often see in our movement disorders clinics include:</p>
