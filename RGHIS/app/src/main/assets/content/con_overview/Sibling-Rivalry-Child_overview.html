<h2>Sibling Rivalry</h2>
<p>Sibling rivalry is all about competition. Age gap and sex similarities affect the intensity of sibling rivalry. Experts generally agree that jealousy and rivalry are more intense when the age gap between the siblings is from one to three years. The intensity will heighten especially if the siblings are of the same sex.</p>
<p>Sibling rivalry is also about power struggle. According to Dr Albert Adler, a famous psychologist and ardent follower of Sigmund Freud, &quot;kid squabbling is really based on subconscious strive for power.&quot; As parents love and nurture the tiny infant, he will develop positively and slowly learn to compete with his siblings, who are &quot;vying&quot; for a share of love and attention.</p>
<h2>Preparing Your Child For The Arrival Of A Baby</h2>
<p>For very young toddlers or preschoolers, inform your toddler of your pregnancy only in the last few months, when your tummy is showing and your child notices that you are more tired than usual.</p>
<p>Assure the older child that with the arrival of the baby, his position will not be threatened and that you will continue to love him as much.</p>
<p>Prepare him realistically that the young baby will be very helpless, needs care and may even cry a lot. The older sibling should also not expect the young infant to be able to play with him until a few years later.</p>
<p>Prepare your child for the temporary separation when you have to go to the hospital to deliver the baby. </p>
<p>Involve the older sibling by giving him the responsibility of calling the grandparents to announce the baby's arrival. But do not overplay the return of the baby as it will threaten the confidence of the older child in his position in the family. </p>
<p>For older siblings who are of school-going age, you may also find that he is keen to be involved in the care process. Having a baby in the home also allows him a wonderful opportunity to act in a grown-up role.</p>
<p>Be prepared to detect resentment. Some younger children may express jealousy with blunt and frank comments. If resentment and jealousy are detected, you must allow your older child to express his fears and feelings but with a firm rule stating that at all times, no violence is accepted in the home.</p>
<p>Do not leave a young toddler or pre-schooler alone with the baby until later when bonding is more firmly established.</p>
<p>Sibling rivalry is perfectly normal. The battle between brothers and sisters is one of the most basic and universal of family relationships. As parents, you do not have to eliminate sibling rivalry. Rather, it can be constructive if it is managed well.</p>

<h2>Why Kids Fight</h2>
<p>Most siblings experience some degree of jealousy or competition and this causes squabbles or arguments. Other factors that influence how often kids fight and how severe it may be include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Evolving needs: Childrens changing needs, anxieties and identities do affect how they relate to one another. For example, toddlers are naturally protective of their toys and belongings and are learning to assert their will. School age children often have a strong concept of fairness and equality, so might not understand why siblings of other ages are treated differently or may feel like one child gets preferential treatment. Teenagers, on the other hand, are developing a sense of individuality and independence, and are not happy to help with household responsiblities, taking care of younger siblings, or even having to spend time together. </li>
    <li>Individual temperaments: Childrens individual temperaments, including mood, disposition and adaptability, play a major role in how well they get along. </li>
    <li>Special needs/sick child: Sometimes, a childs special needs due to illness or learning/emotional issues may require more parental time. Siblings may pick up on this disparity and act out to get attention or out of fear. </li>
    <li class=last>Role models: The way that parents resolve problems and disagreements is a strong example. If parents work through conflicts in a respectful, productive and non aggressive way, the chances are that children will also adopt these methods when resolving issues/problems with one another. If adults routinely shout, slam doors and loudly argue, siblings are likely to do the same. </li>
</ul>
