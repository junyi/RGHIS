<h2>Vomitting in Children</h2>
<font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Causes></div>
<h2>Cause</h2>
<p>Most vomiting is caused by a viral infection of the lining of the stomach or by food poisoning. Often, a child who is vomiting may also develop diarrhoea.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the vomiting may be caused by a more serious illness, such as intestinal obstruction (blockage of the bowels), which will require surgical attention. If the vomiting is associated with severe headache, infection of the brain or a bleed or growth in the brain may be possible causes.</p>
<h2>Expected Course</h2>
<p>The vomiting usually stops in 6 to 24 hours. Changes in the diet usually speed recovery. If your child has diarrhoea, it will often continue for several days.</p>
