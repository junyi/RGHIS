            Hydronephrosis is the distention or swelling of the kidney as urine builds up in the kidney. This is due to a partial or complete obstruction of the flow of urine at the upper end of the ureter or tube that brings the urine from the kidney to the bladder. Hydronephrosis can sometimes develop in children; however, most often babies are born with the condition. It is one of the common abnormalities of the urinary tract. </p>

            Causes</span></h2>
            <p>Hydronephrosis of one kidney is most commonly caused by an incomplete blockage at the junction between the kidney urine collecting system, and the urine drain pipe (pelvicalyceal system and ureter). This is called a PUJO. This is an in-born condition and is not known to be inherited or related to food or behaviour during pregnancy. <br>
            <br>
            Other causes include the backflow of urine from the bladder into the kidneys or a blockage of the lower end of the ureter.</p>
