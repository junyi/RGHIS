            <p>Percutaneous aortic valve replacement is a minimally invasive procedure to correct severe aortic stenosis. This is a condition where the hearts aortic valve becomes narrowed or obstructed, preventing it from opening properly and blocking the flow of blood from the left lower chamber of the heart to the aorta. In this procedure, the diseased aortic valve is replaced to restore normal blood flow. </p>

            <p>The percutaneous aotic valve replacement is performed through a small incision of 4  6 cm at the groin or chest where a balloon catheter pre-mounted with a tissue valve is guided to the diseased heart valve. The doctor uses echocardiographic and fluoroscopic guidance for visualisation during the valve delivery. Once at the diseased site, the new valve is placed across the stenotic valve by balloon expansion. This method reduces the trauma to patients as the heart need not be opened up as with the case of the surgical approach and could possibly lead to a faster recovery and shorter hospital stay. </p>

            <p>Patients with severe aortic stenosis and are not suitable for surgical aortic valve replacement due to multiple medical problems, such as very advanced age, poor heart function, renal failure, severely calcified aorta, previous scarred chest due to surgery or irradiation. Aortic stenosis occurs in approximately 2% of the population above 65 years old and 4% of those above 75 years old. </p>
