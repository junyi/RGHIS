<h2>Pain Relief in Labour</h2>
<p><em>By Department of Womens Anaesthesia, KK Women's and Children's Hospital</em></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Expecting a baby is definitely one of the most joyful experiences in your life, so it is important that the labour and delivery are safe and pleasant.</p>
<p>Tolerance to labour pain varies among individuals, but it is best for you to be open-minded to all pain relief methods.</p>
<p>Your active participation in planning your childbirth, together with the help of your obstetrician, the anaesthesiologist, midwife and your partner, will let you experience a comfortable and rewarding labour.</p>
<h2>What Is Labour Pain All About?</h2>
<h3>1st stage of labour</h3>
<p>During this stage, uterine contractions occur at regular intervals. These are accompanied by dilatation of your cervix to allow your baby's head to pass into the birth canal. Pain is felt in your lower abdomen and sometimes in your back.</p>
<h3>2nd stage of labour</h3>
<p>During this stage, contractions continue. In addition, a bearing-down sensation or pressure helps you to push your baby's head down the birth canal, stretching the muscles and tissues of the vagina.</p>
<h3>The 3rd stage of labour involves expulsion of the placenta.</h3>
<p>All these sensations are conveyed through the nerves to your spine, when messages are transmitted to the brain which releases the pain signal to your body.</p>
<p>The duration of labour and severity of labour pain, is difficult, if not impossible, to predict. The range is from a few hours to 12 hours or more, but it is important to realise that prolonged pain and stressful labour is undesirable for both yourself and your baby. Resorting to pain relief methods during labour is not an indication of failure, but is a means of having a pleasant birth to which every mother-to-be is entitled.</p>
