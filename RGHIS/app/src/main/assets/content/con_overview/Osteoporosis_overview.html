            <p><a class=ms-asset-internalBookmark id=Overview title=Overview></a>Osteoporosis is a condition that causes thinning and weakening of bones. Brittle bones are more prone to fractures. These fractures may happen even with very minimal trauma. Although any bone can be affected, the fractures typically occur in the hip, spine and wrist. <br>
            <br>
            Worldwide, 200 million women suffer from osteoporosis and a womans risk of hip fracture is the same as her combined risk of developing breast, uterine and ovarian cancer. In Singapore, the number of osteoporosis - related hip fractures in women over 50 years is 8 times more than that of breast cancer cases.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Who is at risk?<br>
            </strong><br>
            Although women 50 years or older are most at risk for osteoporosis, younger women and men can also be affected. <br>
            <br>
            Peak bone mass is attained by the age of 30. After that, bone mass gradually decreases. In pregnant and lactating women, the pace of bone loss will temporarily increase if the increased calcium demands of pregnancy or breastfeeding are not met by increased dietary intake of calcium. In women, there is also a significant decrease of bone mass in the immediate period following the onset of menopause. </p>

            <a class=ms-asset-internalBookmark id="Risk Factors" title="Risk Factors"></a>Risk Factors</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>Risk factors can be divided into those that can be changed and others that cannot.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Risk factors that cannot be changed</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Age - The risk for osteoporosis increases as one gets older </li>
                <li>A woman who has gone through menopause - After menopause, the body produces less estrogen, estrogen protects the body from bone loss </li>
                <li>Family history of osteoporosis or osteoporosis-related fractures </li>
                <li>Slender body frame (small bone structure) </li>
                <li>Race - A person of Caucasian or Asian ancestry is more at risk </li>
                <li>Low bone mass or osteopenia </li>
                <li>Previous fracture following a low level trauma, especially after age 50 </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Risk factors that can be changed</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Smoking - Dont smoke as smoking causes bone loss and early menopause </li>
                <li>Excessive alcohol consumption - Excessive amounts of alcohol not only reduce bone formation, it also affects the bodys ability to absorb calcium </li>
                <li>Sedentary lifestyle </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Other causes of osteoporosis</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Medications: Using some medications long term can damage bone. These include corticosteroids to treat chronic conditions such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis etc, medications<br>
                that lower sex hormones, some anti-seizure medications and sometimes thyroid hormone when prescribed in high doses. Talk with your health care provider about the medications you take </li>
                <li>Other causes: Various conditions can interfere with calcium absorption and contribute to bone loss. These include liver or kidney disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid), Cushings disease (in which the body produces excess cortisol) and conditions like anorexia nervosa </li>
            </ul>
