            <p><strong>What is Nasopharyngeal Cancer?<br>
            </strong><br>
            The area behind the nose and just above the back of the throat is called the nasopharynx. The cells lining the nasopharynx can become cancerous and give rise to nasopharyngeal cancer or NPC. </p>
            <p><strong>How common is Nasopharyngeal Cancer?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Nasopharyngeal cancer has moved from the fifth to the sixth position in most common cancer in men and was no longer among the ten most frequent cancers in females in Singapore. It affects men more frequently than women and it occurs between the ages of 35 to 55 years. This type of cancer is more frequently seen among the Chinese(especially Cantonese). It is not as common in USA or Europe. </p>
