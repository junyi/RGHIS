            <p>Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is a temporary life support technique to keep patients alive when their heart and/or lungs stop functioning. It can be used to provide support for up to a few weeks, during which the patient recovers. If recovery does not occur, the patient can get a longer-term mechanical assist device or undergo a heart transplantation. Patients on ECMO support are given an anticoagulant, to prevent blood clotting in the external system.</p>
