            </span></h2>
            <strong><br>
            Common Causes </strong> 
            <p>In Singapore, head injury occurs most commonly after motor vehicle accidents, falls at home or at work, acts of violence, sports and recreational injuries.</p>
            <strong>Types of Head Injury</strong>  
            <p>Head injury can be mild to severe in nature, and damage to the brain may occur immediately at the time of injury, or develop after the injury due to swelling or further bleeding. The common types of head injury include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scalp injury</strong>  refers to the bump, cuts and lacerations of the scalp. Treatments include cold compression and suturing. </li>
                <li><strong>Skull fracture</strong>  refers to the break or crack in the skull bone.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Linear skull fracture</strong>  Treatment is usually conservative as it does not cause many problems. </li>
                    <li><strong>Depressed skull fracture</strong> is caused by direct impact onto the skull, which caused the shattered bones to be pushed into the brain. Antibiotics and surgery to prevent further brain injury, bleeding and infection may be needed. </li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Concussion</strong>  is a &quot;shake&quot; to the head. Most people recover without any permanent damage. Symptoms such as headache, giddiness, nausea, vomiting etc may persist, but will get completely better over time. Treatments include medications for symptom relief and adequate rest. </li>
                <li><strong>Contusion</strong>  is a &quot;bruise&quot; that may cause tissue damage and bleeding. </li>
                <li><strong>Haematomas (Blood Clots)</strong>  refers to the collection of blood in one or several locations of the brain. Treatments for contusion and haematomas include observation for worsening of symptoms to removal of blood clots. Prognosis depends on the type, size and effect of the lesions on the brain. </li>
            </ul>
