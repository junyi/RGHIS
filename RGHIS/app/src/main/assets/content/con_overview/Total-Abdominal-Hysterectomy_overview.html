<h1>Total Abdominal Hysterectomy</h1>
<h2>What Is Total Abdominal Hysterectomy?</h2>
<p>This is a very common operation where the uterus (womb) and cervix (neck of the womb) are removed. After a hysterectomy, you will not have any more menstrual periods and will not be able to bear any more children. The ovaries may or may not be removed at the same time.</p>
<div id="Risk Factors"></div>
<h2>Are There Any Risks Involved?</h2>
<p>Complications are rare but there are risks involved with any operation. These may be related to the anaesthesia or the operation. Risks related to the operation include bleeding, infection and injury to the abdominal organs such as the intestines, urinary bladder or ureter. Blood clots may occur in the legs or lungs; and occasionally, there may be slow return of bowels and bladder function.</p>
<p>The risks are higher in overweight patients, patients with poorly controlled medical problems (diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease) and patients with previous abdominal surgery.</p>
<h2>How Can These Risks Be Reduced?</h2>
<p>Prior to the operation, you may be referred to a physician and / or anaesthetist to ensure that your medical problems are well controlled. On your part, you should remember to follow the doctor's instructions and take your medicine regularly.</p>
