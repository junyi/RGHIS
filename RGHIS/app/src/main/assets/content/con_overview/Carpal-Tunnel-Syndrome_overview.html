            <p><strong>What is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?</strong></p>
            <p>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) refers to the compression of the median nerve at the wrist in a structure called the carpal tunnel.The median nerve carries sensation from the palmar surface of the thumb and fingers (except the little finger). It also controls the muscles that move the thumb. The carpal tunnel is formed by wrist bones and a ligament called flexor retinaculum that runs across the wrist. This 'tunnel' is a narrow passageway for the median nerve as well as the many tendons that control finger movements. Swelling or thickening of any of the structures in or around the carpal tunnel may compress the median nerve, leading to pain, numbness and weakness of the hand and thumb. </p>

            <p><strong>Causes and Risk Factors</strong></p>
            <p>Many factors act to increase the pressure on the median nerve and tendons in the carpal tunnel. Some people may be born with narrower carpal tunnels, predisposing them to develop CTS. It is three times more common in women. Repetitive wrist movement, e.g. flexing of the wrist when using a computer mouse, may aggravate CTS. People with diabetes, obesity, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis and injury to the wrist are more likely to develop CTS. It is also more common in pregnant women.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>CTS can be confirmed by nerve conduction tests. It involves giving very small electric shocks to the median nerve and recording its electrical signals across the wrist. The test usually takes about half an hour. It is a safe procedure that does not require any sedation or anaesthesia.</p>
