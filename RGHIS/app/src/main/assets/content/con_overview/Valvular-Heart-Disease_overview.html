            <p>Valvular heart disease is a disorder or disease of the heart valves, which are the tissue flaps that regulate the flow of blood into and out of the chambers of the heart.</p>
            <p>Patients with valvular heart disease have a malfunction of one or more of the heart valves. There are several types of valvular heart diseases with distinct symptoms and treatment options.</p>
            <p>Problems with heart valves may occur as a result of infections (most commonly infective endocarditis and rheumatic fever), degeneration, or congenital abnormality.</p>
