<h2>Perinatal Depression</h2>
<p>Pregnancy and childbirth are special times in the lives of many women. And many of us, women, will experience motherhood, or at least come in close contact with pregnant women. But sometimes, instead of being excited, joyful and in the brink of good health, a picture which we have come to associate with motherhood, you can find yourself struggling to cope with depression. </p>
<p>Pregnancy is a period that can bring on worrying changes in the psyche of a woman, as she navigates a dramatic transition within herself. This booklet aims to provide information on depression occurring during and after pregnancy, the symptoms and possible causes, and what can be done to help you if you suffer from perinatal depression.</p>
