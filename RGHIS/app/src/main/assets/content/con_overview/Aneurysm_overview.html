            <p>Aneurysm is localised abnormal widening of the blood vessel due to weakening of the vessel wall. Although the widening of blood vessel can compress on important organs, the most dangerous complication of aneurysm is rupture of the aneurysm when it increases to a certain size. Aneurysms can occur in any artery, but rupture of aneurysms in the aorta or brain is usually fatal.</p>
