<h1 class=sectionbanner>RETINAL DETACHMENT</h2>
<p><em>When the occasional occurrence of floaters (seeing little dots and lines in one's vision) suddenly increases and occurs with seeing sudden flashes of light, it could signal retinal detachment -- a serious problem that requires immediate medical attention.</em></p>

<h2>What is retinal detachment?</h2>
<p>Retinal detachment occurs when the  separates from the outer layers of the eye. If not treated early, retinal detachment may lead to partial or complete loss of vision.</p>

<h2>What causes retinal detachment?</h2>
<p>Retinal detachment usually occurs after tears develop in the retina (). Fluid passes through these openings and separates the retina from the other layers of the eye.<br>

<h2>How do I know if I have retinal detachment?</h2>
<p>Middle-aged and older persons may see . Some retinal detachments can go unnoticed until a large section of the retina is detached. In these instances, patients may notice the appearance of a dark shadow in some parts of their vision. Further retinal detachment will blur central vision and create significant sight loss in the affected eye.</p>
<p>A few detachments may occur suddenly and the patient will experience a total loss of vision in one eye. </p>

<h2>What puts me at risk of retinal detachment?</h2>
<p> increases the risk of retinal detachment, as it leads to thinning of the retina, and therefore an increased risk of developing holes or tears. Family history may contribute to the risk. Another risk factor is after surgery for . Retinal detachments can also be caused by other diseases in the eye such as tumours, severe inflammation, or as a complication from diabetes.</p>

<h2>How can I prevent retinal detachment?</h2>
<p>If you have any of the risk factors for retinal detachment, you may consider avoiding activities where there is a risk of shock or pressure on the head or eyes. Frequent eye examinations can pick up problems early. With prompt treatment, a torn retina can be fixed before full retinal detachment occurs. </p>

<h2>What kinds of treatments are available for retinal detachment?</h2>
<p>SNEC provides a range of treatments for retinal detachments, including:</p>
<p> Laser photocoagulation, which uses a laser to seal retinal tears at the early stages;<br>
 Freezing or croypexy, a treatment that involves freezing the sclera behind the retinal tear.  This is <br>
  usually done in conjunction with scleral buckle surgery;<br>
 Scleral buckle surgery surgical repair. This involves supporting the retinal breaks with a silicone<br>
  band which goes round the eye.<br>
 Vitrectomy, a procedure for complex cases of retinal detachment. Vitrectomy involves removing<br>
  the vitreous (the jelly-like substance in the eye cavity) and filling the eye with gas or oil.</p>
<p>Over 90% of all retinal detachments can be reattached by modern surgical techniques. Occasionally, more than one operation may be required. </p>
<p>The degree of vision that returns six months after successful surgery will vary.</p>
