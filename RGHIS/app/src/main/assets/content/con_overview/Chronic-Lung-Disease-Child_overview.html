            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Chronic lung disease</strong>, also known as <strong>bronchopulmonary dysplasia</strong>, is a long-term respiratory condition, which occurs mainly in infants who were extremely premature at birth. Some babies require mechanical ventilators for several months, even after they leave the hospital. But most babies can be weaned from ventilators by the end of their first year. Babies with chronic lung disease have increased risk of respiratory infection and may have to be re-hospitalised.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes </span></h2>
            <p>The lungs of premature babies are fragile. In chronic lung disease, the lungs are injured through mechanical ventilation and extra oxygen given to premature babies. Once it is injured, the lung tissue becomes inflamed, breaks down and heals with fibrosis. The diseased lung causes difficulty in breathing and the infant will need more oxygen. </p>
            <p>Some causes of lung injury include the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Premature birth during which babies air sacs are not fully developed </li>
                <li>Low amounts of surfactant, a substance in the lungs that keeps the tiny air sacs open </li>
                <li>Prolonged oxygen exposure and use of high concentrations of oxygen cause damage to lung tissues </li>
                <li>Mechanical ventilation; air pressure from breathing machines, and suctioning of the airways damage the cells of the lungs </li>
            </ul>
