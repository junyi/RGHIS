            <p>In Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&amp;G), <strong>Laparoscopy</strong> is also suitable for conditions involving the uterus (myomectomy, hysteroscopy and hysterectomy) and ovaries (cystectomy). <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Removal of ovarian cysts</strong> or <strong>ovarian cystectomy</strong> is commonly performed by laparoscopy. Laparoscopy is performed through small abdominal cuts of about 1cm near the belly button and on either side of the abdomen. This compares with a cut of about 10cm in conventional open surgery. The procedure is carried out under general anaesthesia.<br>
            <br>
            Laparoscopy is also an alternative for procedures such as <strong>myomectomy</strong> (the <strong>removal of uterine fibroids</strong>), <strong>hysterectomy</strong> (<strong>removal of the uterus</strong>) and <strong>hysteroscopy</strong>. <br>
            <br>
            The <strong>laparoscopic procedures</strong> are normally carried out as day surgeries. Patients are able to resume normal activities within 1 to 2 weeks, as compared to a 3-day hospital stay and a period of 4 to 6 weeks in conventional surgery.<br>
