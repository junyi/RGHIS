<h1 class=sectionbanner>DRY EYE</h2>
<h2>What is Dry Eye?</h2>
<p>The surface of the eye is continuously bathed by a layer of tear which keeps the eye wet, protects the eye against infection and assists in healing of surface wounds. In the condition called dry eye syndrome, the quality and/or quantity of tear is abnormal, and this results in damage of the ocular surface, irritation of the eyes or visual disturbances. </p>
