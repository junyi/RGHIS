<p><em>If you have blurred vision or distorted vision where straight lines appear crooked, you could be suffering from macular pucker.</em></p>
<h2>What is an Epiretinal Membrane (Macular Pucker)?<br>
 </h2>
An epiretinal membrane (also called macular pucker) is the formation of a thin membrane over part of the  known as the macula. The macula is the most sensitive part of the eye and plays a central role in processing detailed vision. <br>

<h2>What causes Epiretinal Membranes (Macular Pucker)?</h2>
<p>An epiretinal membrane occurs when the gel-like vitreous in the eye becomes more liquid and exerts an abnormal pull on the retina. This results in small pieces of retina breaking away from the inner wall of the eye. When some vitreous remains on the macula, it stimulates the formation of scar tissue, or the growth of a thin membrane over the retina. Over time, these membrane cells contract and cause the retina to wrinkle, distorting vision. Deterioration of the vitreous can also cause other problems such as , ,  and .  </p>
