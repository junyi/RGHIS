            <p><strong>What is Kidney Cancer?<br>
            </strong><br>
            The two kidneys lie at the flanks of the body just behind the intestines, next to the spine. Kidneys form urine to clear some of the toxins produced by the body. The urine drains from the kidneys into ureters and then into the bladder. From the bladder, urine is passed out of the body. The cells that make up the kidney can become cancerous.</p>
            <p><strong>How common is Kidney Cancer?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Kidney cancer accounts for less than one percent of all cancers. It is slightly more common in men than in women, and is mainly detected in people in their middle-age.</p>
