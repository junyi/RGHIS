            <p><strong>Heart failure</strong> is a condition in which the heart loses the ability to pump enough blood to the bodys tissues. </p>
            <p>As a result, the main body organs and other tissues do not receive enough oxygen and nutrients to function properly.</p>
            <p>A person with heart failure suffers a build-up of fluid in the tissues, called oedema. Heart failure as a result of fluid build-up is called congestive heart failure. Where oedema occurs in the body depends on the part of the heart that is affected by heart failure. For most people, heart failure is a chronic disease with no cure.</p>
            <p>However, it can be managed and treated with medications and changes in diet, exercise and lifestyle habits. , , and  is considered in some cases.</p>

            <p>The most commonly causes of heart failure are:<br>
            -  and  (which may be 'silent')<br>
            - cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscles)<br>
            - <br>
            - heart valve disease<br>
            - <br>
            - alcoholism and drug abuse</p>
            <p>In coronary heart disease, the arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked. A person has a heart attack when blood flow to an area of the heart is completely blocked. The heart muscle suffers damage when its blood supply is reduced or blocked. If the damage affects the hearts ability to pump blood, heart failure develops. Some heart attacks go unrecognised.</p>
            <p>Cardiomyopathy may be caused by coronary artery disease and various other heart problems. Sometimes, the cause cannot be found, in which case it is called idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyopathy can weaken the heart muscle, leading to heart failure.</p>
            <p>High blood pressure is another common cause of heart failure. High blood pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood. After a while, the heart cannot keep up and the symptoms of heart failure develop. Defects of the heart valves, congenital heart diseases, alcoholism, and drug abuse cause damage to the heart that can all lead to heart failure.</p>
