            <em><strong>Can I get asthma in adulthood?</strong> <br>
            <br>
            </em><span class=text>Yes. Asthma can develop at any age, though it is more common in children and teenagers. Some people get asthma for the first time when they are older. More than 13 million people have asthma and 1.5 million of them are 65 years or older. <br>

            <em><span class=text><em><strong>Is asthma inherited?</strong></em> <br>
            <br>
            </span></em><span class=text>Yes, there is a tendency for asthma to be inherited, such that asthma may seem to &quot;run in the family&quot;. If you have a blood relative with asthma or allergies, you are at higher risk of getting asthma. </span></p>
