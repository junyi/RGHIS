            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p>In <strong>hypospadias,</strong> the urine tube in a boy does not open at the tip of the penis, instead the opening is further down, sometimes at the root of the penis or between the testicles. There is often a bend of the penis called a chordee, and there is much more skin on the top than on the under-surface.</p>

            Diagnosis</span></h2>
            <p>Hypospadias, in most cases, is obvious at birth and is diagnosed upon a physical examination. <br>
            <br>
            Some of the mild cases may be missed. Other symptoms include abnormal spraying of urine and having to sit down to pass urine. Left untreated, hypospadias can lead to diffi culty with toilet training, and problems with sexual intercourse as an adult. When diagnosed with hypospadias, the baby will be referred to a paediatric surgeon.</p>

            Causes</span></h2>
            <p>The exact cause is unknown but research suggests that the development of hypospadias may be hormone-related or genetic.</p>
