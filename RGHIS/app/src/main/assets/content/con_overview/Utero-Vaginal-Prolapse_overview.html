<h2>Utero-Vaginal Prolapse</h2>
<h2>What Is Utero-Vaginal Prolapse?</h2>
<p>A prolapse occurs when there is protrusion of an organ or structure beyond its normal position. In utero-vaginal prolapse, there is descent of the uterus and/or vagina. This is a common gynaecological condition but many women do not seek treatment because of embarrassment, or they are unaware that the condition can cause problems and that treatment is available. It is important to seek medical advice early as it can be treated.</p>
<p>Prolapse of the uterus can occur on its own. But it can also be associated with a protrusion of the anterior (front), or posterior (back) wall of the vagina, or both. In women who have had their uterus removed, prolapse of the vagina can occur after surgery. The degree of prolapse can vary from a very mild descent of the pelvic organs, to a severe descent in which the uterus, part of the bladder and part of the rectum (back passage) protrudes through the vaginal opening.</p>

<h2>What Causes The Prolapse?</h2>
<p>This is due to a weakness in the supporting tissues of the uterus and vagina. The common factors leading to this are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pregnancy &amp; Childbirth:</strong> When there can be excessive stretching of the tissues </li>
    <li class=last><strong>After menopause:</strong> When a relative lack of female hormones can lead to thinning and weakening of the tissues </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, any condition that leads to an increase in the pressure in the abdominal cavity (e.g. chronic cough, constipation or heavy lifting) can aggravate the prolapse.</p>
