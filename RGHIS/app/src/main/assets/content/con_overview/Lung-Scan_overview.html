            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Procedure</span></h2>
            <p>This consists of two parts.</p>
            <p><strong>A) Ventilation<br>
            </strong><br>
            You will breathe in an aerosol mixture of oxygen and radioactive tracer for about five minutes. Images of your lungs at different angles will be taken with a Gamma Camera.</p>
            <p><strong>B) Perfusion<br>
            </strong><br>
            After the ventilation images are taken, you will be given a small injection in your vein and the same series of images at the same angles are taken again. </p>
            <p>Patient Preparation </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You will need to sign a consent form before the procedure </li>
                <li>There is no special preparation before the procedure </li>
            </ul>
            </div>
