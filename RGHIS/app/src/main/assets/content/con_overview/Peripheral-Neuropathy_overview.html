            <p><strong>What Is Peripheral Neuropathy? </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Peripheral neuropathy</strong> refers to diseases affecting the peripheral nervous system, which consists of motor or sensory neurons, nerve roots, plexuses and peripheral nerves. Motor nerves control movements of all muscles under conscious control. Sensory inputs (e.g. heat, cold and touch) from skin receptors are conveyed to the brain via the sensory nerves. Autonomic nerves are found in vital organs (e.g. heart, lungs) and help to regulate body functions such as heart rate and breathing. </p>
            <p><strong>Clinical classification of peripheral neuropathy is based on: </strong></p>
            <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
                <li>The part of the peripheral nervous system involved: the peripheral nerve (mono- or poly- neuropathy depending on number of nerves affected), plexus (plexopathy), nerve root (radiculopathy) and sensory neurons (neuronopathy). </li>
                <li>Types of nerve fibers involved, e.g. sensory polyneuropathy when only sensory fibers are affected. </li>
                <li>Underlying mechanism of nerve damage, disorders e.g. demyelinating versus axonal neuropathy. Axonal disorders are due to damage to the nerve fibers, e.g. diabetic polyneuropathy. Demyelinating neuropathies arise from insults to the myelin sheath, e.g. chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS). </li>

            Causes and Risk Factors </span></h2>
            <p>There are many causes of peripheral neuropathy, inherited and acquired. Inherited neuropathies are due to inborn defects in the genetic code and are collectively known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease.</p>
            <p><strong>Causes of acquired peripheral neuropathy include the following:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Physical injury to the nerve. This can be from trauma such as fractures or from acute compression such as 'Saturday Night' palsy. Peripheral nerves are also prone to chronic compression at certain anatomic sites. This is known as entrapment neuropathy. A common example is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS). In this condition, the median nerve gets compressed as it passes through a narrow passageway in the wrist (carpal tunnel). </li>
                <li>Metabolic Neuropathy, e.g.  and renal failure. </li>
                <li>Nutritional Neuropathy, e.g. Vitamin B12 deficiency and chronic alcohol abuse. </li>
                <li>Autoimmune disorders, e.g. Rheumatoid arthritis. </li>
                <li>Infections, e.g. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and leprosy. </li>
                <li>Immune mediated neuropathy. This is due to nerve inflammation from an abnormal immune reaction, e.g. Guillain Barre syndrome. </li>
                <li>Toxins and Drugs, e.g. heavy metals like lead and drugs like Cisplatin. </li>
            </ul>
