            <p><strong>What is Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS)?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS), also known as <strong>'keyhole surgery</strong>, is surgery done through small incisions. <br>
            <br>
            It aims to achieve clinical outcomes comparable to those of conventional open surgery, while minimising the soft-tissue damage that is part of conventional techniques.<br>
            <br>
            MIS uses specialised techniques and instruments like tiny cameras and sophisticated fibre-optic video<br>
            equipment and sometimes image-guided, ultrasound or Computed Tomography (CT) technology to access the operative region. For some procedures, MIS has replaced the conventional open surgery technique as the standard operation.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Benefits of MIS </span></h2>
            <p>Compared to conventional open surgery, MIS has the following potential benefits for patients:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Less trauma to the body </li>
                <li>Less blood loss </li>
                <li>Smaller surgical scars </li>
                <li>Less need for pain medication </li>
                <li>Earlier discharge from hospital </li>
                <li>Earlier return to normal activities </li>
            </ul>

                <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Limitation of MIS</span></h2>
                <p>It is important to recognise that MIS has limitations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>May not be suitable for all patients. </li>
                    <li>May take longer than open surgery. </li>
                    <li>May incur extra costs due to specialised equipment that are more expensive. However, the extra costs may be offset by shorter hospital stay and earlier return to usual activities. </li>
                    <li>Requires specialist training and hence may not be available in some centres. </li>
                    <li>In the event that complications arise, or in unsuitable situations, the minimally invasive surgery may need to be converted to open surgery. </li>
                </ul>
