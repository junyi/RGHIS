<p><strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">I feel pain on some of my teeth. I had checked it out with my dentist and found no cause for it. I am still having the mild pain and am irritated by it. I want to extract those teeth. Why is my dentist refusing to do it?</span></strong><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#666666;line-height:18px">A less common condition is the atypical toothache. The pain is chronic and usually, there is no identifiable cause for it. Extracting the teeth usually does not solve the problem as the pain tends to stay.<br><br>
