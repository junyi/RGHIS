            <p>Uncontrollably sweaty palm is a socially embarrassing condition. Those affected by it would have tried different creams and other therapies. Unfortunately, none of them could cure the sweaty palm permanently.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>VATS sympathectomy</strong> is an operation done via two 5mm incisions on each side of the chest. The surgeon divides the nerve supplying the sweat glands in the hands. This procedure offers permanent cure to this condition. Patients will only need an overnight stay or same day discharge after the operation. Pain and scar formation are minimal.</p>
