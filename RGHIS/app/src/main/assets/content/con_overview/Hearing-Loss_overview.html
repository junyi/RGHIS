            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p>Hearing loss occurs when there is a problem with one or more parts of the ear. In air conduction, sound waves travel through the external ear canal to vibrate the eardrum. Vibration of the eardrum is transmitted to the hearing organ (cochlea) via three small bones (ossicles) in the middle ear. This stimulates the sensory cells in the cochlea which then sends impulses to the hearing nerve (auditory nerve) and on to the brain. <br>
            <br>
            Hearing by bone conduction occurs when sound waves cause the bones of the skull to vibrate which directly stimulate the hearing organ (cochlea) resulting in hearing.</p>

            Causes</span></h2>
            <p>There are 2 types of hearing loss : <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Conductive Hearing Loss</strong> occurs when sound waves cannot be transmitted properly from the external environment to the cochlea. The problem could lie in the external ear canal, eardrum, middle ear bones or middle ear space. <br>
            <br>
            <strong><span style="color:#ff6600">Common Causes of Conductive Hearing Loss include : </span></strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Obstruction in the external ear canal caused by wax, foreign body or infection (otitis externa). </li>
                <li>Perforated eardrum  usually a result of trauma or chronic infection. </li>
                <li>Dislocated, damaged or fi xed ossicles (malleus, incus, or stapes)  from trauma or chronic diseases that erode the ossicles over time or otosclerosis that cause the ossicles to be fixed. </li>
                <li>Otitis media  a middle ear infection, usually with fl uid in the middle ear space. </li>
            </ul>
