            <p>Chronic middle ear infection can cause persistent foul-smelling ear discharge and hearing loss. This is due to a perforation of the eardrum and recurrent infection of the middle ear. The ear perforation is usually the result of previous trauma or infection. <br>
            <br>
            In most instances, the eardrum will heal, but occasionally the perforation persists. It is important to ensure that the patient does not have cholesteatoma.</p>
