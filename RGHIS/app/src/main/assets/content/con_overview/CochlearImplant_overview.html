            <p>The Cochlear Implant is a device which when implanted into the inner ear, provides useful hearing to those with total or severe to profound sensory (inner ear) hearing loss.</p>
            <p>It is not an ordinary hearing aid, but an electronic device that bypasses the damaged parts of the inner ear to stimulate the remaining auditory nerve fibres. Part of the cochlear implant is implanted under the skin in a surgical procedure.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">How a Cochlear Implant works</span></h2>
            <p>With reference to the diagram on the right:</p>
            <p>(a) Sounds enter the system through a small microphone attached behind the ear.</p>
            <p>(b) The sound is sent from the microphone to the speech processor through a tiny cord that connects the two.</p>
            <p>(c) The speech processor selects and codes the elements of sound that are most useful for understanding speech.</p>
            <p>(d) These electronic codes are sent back through the cable to the transmitter. </p>
            <p>(e) The transmitting coil, a plastic covered ring about 33mm in diameter, sends the codes across the skin to the receiver/stimulator.</p>
            <p>(f) The receiver/stimulator contains a custom-designed integrated circuit that converts the codes into special electronic signals and sends them along the electrode array. </p>
            <p>(g) The electrode array is a set of 22 tiny electrode bands, arranged in a row inside a piece of tapered flexible silicone tubing. Each electrode has a wire connecting it to the receiver/stimulator.<br>
            <br>
            (h) The coded electronic signals are sent to specific electrodes, each of which has been separately programmed to deliver sounds that can vary in loudness and pitch. These electrodes then stimulate the appropriate hearing nerve fibres, which send the messages to the brain.</p>
