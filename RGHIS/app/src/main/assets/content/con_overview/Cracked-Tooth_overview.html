<p><span style="color:#666666;line-height:18px">A crack can occur at any part of your tooth. Cracks may differ in depth ( how deeply it penetrates the tooth structure) and length, (how extensive it is), and where it starts. Cracks can be: 
<ul>
    <li>craze lines  superficial tiny cracks which occur within the enamel, which do not cause symptoms and need no treatment </li>
    <li>fracture of a cusp  when part of the chewing surface of a tooth breaks off completely </li>
    <li>cracked tooth  where a crack extends from the biting surfaces to varying depths down the tooth. The crack does not separate the tooth into two segments </li>
    <li>split tooth  the tooth is separated by the crack into two distinct segments </li>
    <li>vertical root fracture  a crack which originates from the root and extends to varying lengths towards the crown. </li>
</ul>

<strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Causes of Cracked Tooth</span></strong><br>
A tooth may crack when it is subjected to stress forces such as biting on hard food, or habits such as grinding of teeth. 
<ul>
    <li>erractic pain on chewing, and on release of biting pressure </li>
    <li>sensitivity on eating cold and hot food </li>
    <li>vague discomfort which is hard to trace to a particular tooth </li>
</ul>

<strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Treatment</span></strong><br>
Treatment of a cracked tooth depends on the extent, type and location of the crack.<br>
Badly cracked teeth may need extraction. If we suspect you have a cracked tooth we will
<ul>
    <li>take radiographs </li>
    <li>localize the tooth, and examine it visually, sometimes through an operating microscope </li>
    <li>if the tooth has a filling, we may remove the filling to examine the tooth better </li>
    <li>splint the tooth with a metal band to prevent further cracks </li>
    <li>institute root canal treatment, if the crack has penetrated into the pulp </li>
    <li>restore the tooth with a full crown for maximum protection, but this does not guarantee success in all cases </li>
</ul>

<strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Prevention</span></strong><br>
You can minimize the risk of developing a cracked tooth by
<ul>
    <li>avoiding chewing on hard food or objects such as ice, hard nuts, and bones </li>
    <li>avoiding habits such as clenching or grinding your teeth </li>
    <li>wearing a mouth guard when playing contact sports </li>
    <li>wearing a night guard if you grind your teeth at night </li>
</ul>
