<p><em>Does your child have constantly red or watery eyes? The cause could be an in-turning of their eyelashes  a condition common in Asian children.</em></p>
<h2>What is Epiblepharon? </h2>
<p>Epiblepharon refers to an in-turning of the eyelashes in the presence of a normal eyelid position. This condition is typically seen in children and young adults of Asian descent. Affected patients have an abnormal congenital horizontal fold of skin near the upper or lower eyelid. This causes the eyelid lashes to be directed towards the eye surface. The constant rubbing of the lashes against the cornea can cause irritation of the cornea and lead to red eyes. In some cases, the cornea may even become scratched and scarred.<br>

  Upper and lower lid lashes         Lashes rubbing against the cornea <br>
  touching the cornea                 causing scratches  <br>
