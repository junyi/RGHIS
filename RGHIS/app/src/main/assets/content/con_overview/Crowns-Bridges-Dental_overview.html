    Crowns can be made of a variety of materials. They can be made of plastic, ceramic or
    metal alloys. A combination of metal and ceramic is also possible to maximise
    strength and simulate the appearance of natural teeth.<br />

    Made?</span></strong><br />
    Firstly, a thorough clinical examination is conducted with radiographs by the
    dentist. The suitability for crowns is assessed and any preparatory work is carried
    out. Your dentist will also be able to advise on material choices, treatment sequence
    and any other concerns you may have.<br />
    <br />
    At the second appointment, the teeth to be crowned are prepared. This involves
    reduction of the tooth size (usually under local anaesthesia) followed by an
    impression or mould of the prepared tooth. This trimming of the tooth is required to
    create space for the crown to be fitted. The mould is then sent to a laboratory where
    skilled technicians will fabricate the crown. Meanwhile, a temporary crown is made
    and fitted onto the trimmed tooth.<br />
    <br />
    At the third appointment, the temporary crown is removed and the tooth surfaces
    cleaned. The completed crown is tried on the tooth for fit, harmony with the bite and
    appearance. The crown is finally cemented onto the prepared tooth with dental
    cement.<br />

    "color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">How Long Do Crowns Last And How Do I Care For
    Them?</span><br /></strong>Crowns are made of inert materials which do not
    deteriorate over time. However, the underlying tooth is still prone to decay and gum
    disease.<br />
    <br />
    Ceramic on the surface may chip or fracture. Avoid chewing excessively hard
    substances like ice or bones.<br />
    <br />
    Daily brushing and flossing are essential for good oral health as well as keeping the
    crown trouble free. The most vulnerable portion of the crown is the margin or the
    junction between tooth and crown.<br />
    <br />
    Regular check-ups will enable your dentist to detect problems with your crown and
    recommend necessary treatment.<br />

    A bridge is a means of replacing missing teeth using neighboring teeth as supporting
    structures.<br />
    <br />
    Bridges are usually done by trimming teeth on either side of a missing tooth like in
    crowns. The crowns made are joined together by adding a tooth in between. The
    resulting structure is called a bridge.<br />
    <br />
    Like crowns, they are also fabricated in a laboratory utilizing the same materials
    and then fitted and cemented in the mouth.<br />
    <br />
    Maintenace care for bridges is similar to that for crowns. The focus is on regular
    flossing, brushing as well as regular checkups.<br />
    <br />
    Further information on bridges can be obtained from your dentist.<br />

    Replaced ?</span></strong><br />
    Bridges can be used to replace a small number of missing teeth if the neighbouring
    teeth are sufficiently strong.<br />
    <br />
    The number of missing teeth, condition of the neighbouring teeth, condition of the
    supporting gums and bone are all important factors which need to be assessed by your
    dentist prior to making a bridge.<br />
    <br />
    Your dentist will also be able to advise on alternative ways of replacing missing
    teeth after a clinical examination.</font><br />
