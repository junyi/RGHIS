<h2>What To Do For Common Childhood Injuries - Advice From The Children's Emergency Physician</h2>
<p>About 10 - 12% of the nearly 400 children who seek treatment everyday at the Children's Emergency at KK Women's and Children's Hospital do so for childhood injuries. Childhood injuries are largely preventable if caregivers are more aware of child safety issues, and exercise caution in the day-to-day care of their children. </p>
<p>Childhood injuries can be serious and fatal. The common causes of death include those due to Road Traffic Accidents, Unintentional Drownings and Falls from height. Countless other children suffer temporary or permanent physical pain or disabilities due to childhood injuries everyday. Such events are also heart-breaking for their caregivers.</p>
<h2>First Aid Box</h2>
<p>It is useful to keep a First Aid box at home. Readily prepared ones are available at the pharmacies. However, if you find these too costly, you can also easily assemble a kit yourself. Some suggested materials for the First Aid Box would include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A box of &quot;Elastoplast&quot; dressings </li>
    <li>A roll of sterile cotton wool, and a few packs of sterile gauze </li>
    <li>A dozen assorted bandages </li>
    <li>Melonin non-stick dressing </li>
    <li>Steristrip to bring small cut skin surfaces together </li>
    <li>A bottle of antiseptic solution like chlorhexidine </li>
    <li>A triangular bandage </li>
    <li>A clinical thermometer </li>
    <li class=last>A pair of clean scissors and forceps </li>
    <li>Safety pins </li>
</ul>
<p>You may want to add on common medications like Paracetamol for fever and aches, and diarrhoea and flu medications. Ensure that you know the correct dosage and use for these medications for your child. What is good for an adult may not be beneficial for a young child. Check with your doctor or the pharmacists when in doubt. </p>
<p>Remember to keep the First Aid box out of reach of your children.</p>
