            <p><strong>What is Brain Cancer?<br>
            </strong><br>
            Brain cancers are generally named after the tissue in which they arise. Majority are glima arising from glial cells in the brain. These include astrocytomas, oligodenrogliomas, ependymomas and mixed cell type gliomas. The other forms of brain cancers are meningiomas, medulloblastomas, chordomas and central nervious system lymphomas.</p>
            <p>Brain cancers can be fast growing (high grade), such as glioblastoma multiforme or slow growing (low grade), such as pilocytic astrocytoma.</p>
            <p>Cancers from other organs can spread to the brain and are called brain metastases. Brain metastases comprise cancer cells from the original site of cancer, such as lung cancer cells and <strong>breast cancer</strong> cells.</p>
            <p><strong>How common is Brain Cancer?</strong><br>
            <br>
            This is an uncommon cancer in Singapore. Between 1968 and 1992 there were about 580 cases reported. Most were astrocytomas and glioblastoma multiforme.</p>
            <p><strong>Age of Onset</strong><br>
            <br>
            Infants have been reported to have brain cancers as well. However, the risk increases after the age of 35 years. In childhood, primary brain and spinal cord cancers are the second leading cause of death from cancer.</p>

            Causes and Risks</span></h2>
            <p>Little is known regarding the cause of brain cancer. These cancers are characterised by a variety of appearances at surgery and under the microscope and by gene analysis.</p>
