            <strong>Myasthenia Gravis (MG)</strong> is a chronic, autoimmune, neuromuscular junction disorder. The neuromuscular junction refers to the tiny cleft between the peripheral nerve endings and the muscle membrane. The nerve endings release the neurotransmitter (acetylcholine), which crosses the junction to bind to receptors on the &quot;distal bank&quot;, the muscle membrane. This activates the receptor, which generates a muscle contraction. <br>
            <br>
            In autoimmune disorder, the body produces antibodies against its own tissue. In MG, antibodies that block, interfere, or destroy the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction are made, resulting in easy fatigability and fluctuating muscle weakness. </div>
