<h2>Urinary Incontinence</h2>
<h2>What Is Urinary Incontinence?</h2>
<p>Urinary incontinence is the uncontrollable leakage of urine. It is more common in the elderly, especially among women. Urinary incontinence is not a natural process of ageing.</p>
<h2>How Does Your Bladder Empty Urine?</h2>
<p>The lower urinary tract consists of the urinary bladder and the bladder outlet. In a healthy person, the bladder stores urine and voids at the person's convenience. During the storage phase, the bladder relaxes and the bladder outlet contracts. No urine leaks out. However, when the bladder and / or the bladder outlet are not functioning normally, urine may leak.</p>

<h2>Causes Of Urinary Incontinence</h2>
<p>Sometimes, conditions such as urinary tract infection, vaginal inflammation, constipation, restricted physical movements (e.g. stroke, Parkinson's diseases and arthritis) and side-effects from certain medicines can cause or worsen urinary incontinence. These situations are only temporary and can be cured when these causes are treated.However, if urinary incontinence is still present after these temporary causes have been treated, it could be due to the bladder's inability to store or empty urine properly or a urethral malfunction.</p>
<p>Below are some common factors that cause urinary incontinence:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Weak pelvic floor muscles supporting the bladder outlet. Multiple childbirths, menopause, obesity and the lack of pelvic floor exercises can weaken the muscles. </li>
    <li>Nerve disorders like stroke and dementia causing a loss of bladder control. When the bladder muscles are too active, urine leaks. However, in 90% of the women with overactive bladder, no cause can be found. </li>
    <li>Incomplete emptying of the bladder causes urinary retention and overflow. </li>

<h2>Types Of Urinary Incontinence</h2>
<p>There are four types of urinary incontinence:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Leakage of urine when you cough, sneeze, laugh or lift something heavy (stress incontinence). </li>
    <li>Leakage of urine before you can reach a toilet (urge incontinence). </li>
    <li>Inability to stop urine from constantly dribbling out; you may sense a full bladder but you have difficulty emptying it completely (overflow incontinence). </li>
    <li>A false connection between the bladder or the ureter to the vagina (fistula). </li>
</ol>
