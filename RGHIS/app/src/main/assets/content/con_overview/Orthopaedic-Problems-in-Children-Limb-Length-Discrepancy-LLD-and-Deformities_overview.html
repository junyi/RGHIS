            LLD or inequality in the lengths of the lower limb is usually a source of concern for many parents. Fortunately most times these difference are so small that they are not apparent clinically and do not warrant any intervention. <br>
            <br>
            However, in a smaller group of patients there can be a significant difference in which case the source needs to be investigated and appropriate treatment instituted. </div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Introduction>

            <p>Some of the conditions that can cause LLD are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hemi hypertrophy - Idiopathic (no known cause) or secondary to increase blood flow to the limb </li>
                <li>Hip conditions - Like neglected dislocations </li>
                <li>Arrest of the growth plate secondary to infections and injury to the growing areas of the lower limbs </li>
                <li>Foot condition like clubfeet which causes the aff ected foot to be smaller leading to a shorter foot height and subsequently a shorter leg </li>
            </ul>
            </div>
