            <p><strong>What is brain aneurysm?<br>
            </strong><br>
            A brain aneurysm is a weak or thin spot on a blood vessel in the brain that balloons out and fills with blood. It is usually located along main arteries that run on the underside of the brain and the base of the skull. </p>
            <p><strong>Who is affected? </strong></p>
            <p>Brain aneurysms can occur in all age groups, with peak age of rupture presentation ranging between 40 to 60 years old. Women have a higher incidence than men. <br>
            <br>
            The exact mechanism on how aneurysms develop is still not fully understood. It is thought to be a degenerative process with a number of contributory factors such as increasing age, smoking, atherosclerosis (a blood vessel disease in which fats build up on the inside of artery walls), and high blood pressure. <br>
            <br>
            Injury or trauma to blood vessels, infection, tumor, alcohol and drug (e.g. cocaine) abuse may cause aneurysm. Brain aneurysms are also more common in people with certain genetic diseases, such as connective tissue disorders, polycystic kidney disease and certain circulatory disorders, such as arteriovenous malformation. </p>
