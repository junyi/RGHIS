<h1 class=sectionbanner>AESTHETIC EYELID SURGERY</h2>
<em>The signs of ageing  drooping eyelids, cheeks and foreheads  can be corrected with aesthetic procedures to regain a more youthful look.<br>
</em> <br>
<h2>What is Aesthetic Eyelid Surgery?</h2>
<br>
Aesthetic eyelid or eyeplastic surgery is a form of cosmetic surgery that enhances the look of the area around the eye by removing the excess skin and fat that makes the face look tired and old. Advancements in technologies and techniques in the last decade mean that today, cosmetic eye surgery requires less invasive surgeries, has better outcomes and entails shorter recovery times. Aesthetic eyelid surgery also deals with the creation of double eyelids in Asian eyes.<br>

<h2>How does Aesthetic Eyelid Surgery work?</h2>
<br>
 As one ages, the skin becomes thinner and loses its elasticity, causing it to stretch, sag and lose its volume. The skin around the eyes is particularly delicate and show more obviously the effects of ageing. Aesthetic eyelid surgery works to reverse these signs of ageing and help regain a youthful appearance by reducing or eradicating the signs of sagging around the eyes and forehead. With an expert understanding of the structure of the eyes and face, eye plastic surgeons at SNEC can deal with the eyes and face as a whole to improve the appearance of the eyelids as well as the surrounding facial structures. The common aesthetic eye plastic procedures include: minimally invasive or small-incision eyelid, forehead, and periorbital rejuvenation surgery.<br>

<h2>The Ageing Eyelid</h2>
<p>The eyes are often the first features that draw attention and therefore form an important aspect of facial attractiveness and beauty. Over time, ageing can cause the upper and lower eyelids to appear droopy or become baggy. <br>
<br>
Sagging skin, the weakening of facial muscles, and build up of fat pockets around the eyes, can give rise to unsightly eye bags or rings. At the same time, age and gravity can cause the eyebrow area to sag or droop. Apart from aesthetics, such conditions may also impair vision and cause eye strain or fatigue.<br>
