            <p><strong>What is an anal abscess?</strong></p>
            <p>An anal abscess is an infected cavity filled with pus found near the anus or rectum. If the skin over the abscess breaks, pus may discharge out. Many people may confuse this with hemorrhoids (piles).<br>
            <strong><br>
            What is an anal fistula?</strong></p>
            <p>An anal fistula, almost always the result of a previous abscess, is a small tunnel connecting the anal gland from which the abscess arose to the skin of the buttocks outside the anus.</p>

            <p><strong>Anal Abcess</strong></p>
            <p>An abscess usually results from an acute infection of a small gland just inside the anus, when bacteria or foreign matter enters the tissue through the gland. Certain conditions, for example, inflammation of the intestine or colitis, can sometimes make these infections more likely. <br>
            <strong><br>
            Anal Fistula</strong></p>
            <p>After an abscess has been drained, a tunnel may persist connecting the anus or rectum to the skin. Persistent drainage of pus from the outside opening may indicate the presence of this tunnel. If the outside opening of the tunnel heals while the inside opening remains, recurrent abscess may develop. </p>
