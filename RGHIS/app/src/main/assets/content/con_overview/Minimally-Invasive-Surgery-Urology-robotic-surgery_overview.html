            <p><strong>Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery</strong> (or <strong>Da Vinci robotic surgery</strong>) is a minimally invasive surgical technique for complex urological surgery. It has been used in our centre for radical prostatectomy (prostate gland removal), nephrectomy (kidney removal), and pyeloplasty (repair of narrowed ureters), amongst others.</p>

            The key benefits of robotic surgery include faster recovery from smaller incision wounds and less pain, lower blood loss and reduced need for transfusion, better vision and tissue dissection from a magnified view and use of special robotic instruments.<br>
            <br>
            In patients who need radiation therapy, brachytherapy (seed implant) is a minimally invasive option where permanent radioactive tiny rice grainsized seeds are inserted through the skin in the perineum (between the scrotum and anus) under ultrasound guidance.<br>
