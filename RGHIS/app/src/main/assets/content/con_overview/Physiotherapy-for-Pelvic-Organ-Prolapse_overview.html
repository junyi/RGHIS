<h2>Physiotherapy for Pelvic Organ Prolapse</h2>
<h2>What is Pelvic Organ Prolapse?</h2>
<p>Pelvic organs are structures found in the pelvic cavity. They include the bladder, womb and bowel. Pelvic organ prolapse occurs when the supporting structures of the organs and the pelvic floor muscles are weakened. Thus, one or more of the pelvic organs will descend from their normal position. This is a common medical condition and is treatable.</p>
