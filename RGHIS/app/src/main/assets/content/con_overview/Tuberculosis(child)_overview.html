            <p>Tuberculosis, or TB for short, can cause a serious and potentially fatal illness if left untreated or improperly treated. TB is contagious and therefore it is a public health problem that requires active tracing of contacts. </p>

            Causes </span></h2>
            <p>TB is caused by certain germs (bacteria) known as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. </p>
            <p>It is spread in the air via small airborne droplets that are usually produced when someone who is sick with TB coughs, laughs, sings, or sneezes. Anyone who breathes in the TB germs <span style="text-decoration:underline">can</span> get infected. The chances of your child being infected with TB depends on several factors, like how infectious the sick person is, whether he/she covers his/her mouth and nose when coughing, how close and how long your child was in contact with the sick person, and whether the sick person has been treated adequately with anti-TB medications.</p>
            <p>Generally speaking, approximately <strong>30 - 40% of close contacts</strong> (typically household members, although schoolmates and colleagues can be affected as well) of a person with infectious TB become infected with TB. However, children with TB are usually much less infectious compared to adolescents or adults. Your child <span style="text-decoration:underline">cannot</span> become infected by simply sharing washed drinking containers or eating utensils, or by touching or hugging infected persons.</p>
