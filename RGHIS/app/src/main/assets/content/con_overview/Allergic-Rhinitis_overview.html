            <p>Allergic rhinitis is caused by the bodys immune response to an environmental trigger.</p>
            <p><strong><span style="color:#ff6600">Other types of rhinitis</span></strong></p>
            Other less common types of rhinitis include :
            <p><strong>Atrophic rhinitis</strong></p>
            <p>In atrophic rhinitis, the natural mucosal membrane is thinned out and the glands that secrete mucus and participate in mucus clearance are lost. This leads to secondary infections and persistent crusting of the nose. This is a rare condition that occurs in those who have undergone aggressive surgery to the nasal cavities.</p>
            <p><strong>Vasomotor rhinitis</strong></p>
            <p>Vasomotor rhinitis is a condition where there is chronic rhinitis in the absence of an identifiable allergy. Dilation of blood vessels in the nose is partly controlled by the autonomic nervous system. It is believed that an oversensitivity of this autonomic nervous system can cause vasomotor rhinitis. In some cases, the trigger may be a change of temperature or the presence of a chemical stimulant like strong perfume or chemical fumes.</p>
