            <p>Anal warts are a common condition affecting the area around the anus. They may also affect the skin around the genitals. They may start as tiny spots, as small as a pinhead, and may grow larger than the size of a pea. They usually do not cause pain or discomfort and patients may be unaware that the warts are present. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes</span></h2>
            <p>They are caused by the human papilloma virus. It is relatively contagious. The virus can be transmitted from person to person, almost always by direct contact. <br>

            <strong><em><span class=text><strong><em>Must these warts be removed?  <br>
            </em></strong></span></em></strong><span class=text><br>
            Yes. If they are not removed, the warts generally grow larger and become more in number. In addition, there is evidence that some of these warts can become cancerous if left untreated for a long time.</span></p>
