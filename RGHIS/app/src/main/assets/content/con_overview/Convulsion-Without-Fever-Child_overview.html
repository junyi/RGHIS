<h2>Convulsion Without Fever</h2>
<p>During a convulsion (seizure), a child becomes unconscious and falls, the eyes roll backwards, the body stiffens, and the arms and legs jerk. </p>
<p>Most seizures last less than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Convulsions without fever occur in 0.4% of children. If they become recurrent, the child is said to have epilepsy. </p>
<p>Recurrent seizures can be controlled with special medications (anti-convulsants).</p>
