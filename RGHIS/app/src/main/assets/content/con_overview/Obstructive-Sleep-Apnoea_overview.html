            <p><strong>Obstructive Sleep Apnoea</strong> is a condition in which the patient has recurrent blockage to his breathing during sleep. The muscles of the upper airway relax as the patient is entering the deeper stages of sleep, causing the upper airway to collapse. Oxygen levels in the blood drop, and there is a reflex rise in heart rate and blood pressure. The brain will arouse enough to allow the muscles in the upper airway to regain their tone and open up the airway and allow the blockage to resolve. However, as the patient again attempts to fall into a deeper stage of sleep, the process recurs. </p>
