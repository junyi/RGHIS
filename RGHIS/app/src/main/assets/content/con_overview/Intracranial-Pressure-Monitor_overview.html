                <li>Patients who require sedation and/or ventilation hence making clinical exam difficult such as in a setting of multiple system injury. </li>

                <li>This is a more sensitive and accurate method of measuring intracranial pressure which also enables quantification of the . ICP value The reliance of clinical signs and parameters to indicate raised or rising intracranial pressure is a qualitative method which is not as sensitive or accurate. The use of an ICP monitor would also enable us to guide our therapeutic measures and confirm that our therapeutic measures are adequate. Failure to promptly detect and treat raised ICP can lead to brain injury resulting in disability and even death </li>
