<h1 class=sectionbanner>MYOPIC MACULOPATHY</h2>
<em>If you have high degree myopia (shortsightedness) of over 600 degrees, you could be at risk of certain eye conditions -- one such problem is called myopic maculopathy.</em> <br>

<h2>What is Myopic Maculopathy?</h2>
<p>Eyes which have short sightedness of over 600 degrees are classified as having high myopia. Myopia occurs when the eyeball is too long and light rays entering the eye are unable to focus on the light-sensitive part of the eye called the retina. () In high myopia, the excessive elongation of the eyeball leads to degeneration of the retina, in particular, to a central part of the retina called the macula. The macula has the highest concentration of cones (light sensitive cells that interpret colour images) in the retina and plays a central role in processing detailed images. ()</p>
 
<p>Highly myopic eyes are associated with an increased risk of , ,  and choroidal neovascularisation. </p>
