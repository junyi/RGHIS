            <p>The Signal Averaged ECG is is a special electrocardiogram (ECG) that records the electrical activity of your heart over a period of 10-15 minutes. A computer scans the heartbeats for late electrical activity that occur after a normal contraction. This late electrical activity is a major cause of abnormal fast heartbeat which is not recorded by a normal ECG.<br>
            <br>
            This test allows the doctor to identify patients at risk of a dangerous heart rhythm that may lead to sudden cardiac death.<br>
            <br>
            There is no hospitalisation required.</p>

            <p>You will lie on a bed while the test is being performed. It is important that you lie as still as possible, breathe normally and do not talk during the procedure as the computer is very sensitive to movements, coughing and turning.</p>
            <p>The medical technologist (MT) will place the electrodes on your chest and back to acquire the ECG. A special ECG machine will amplify and average the ECG signals until almost all noise is eliminated. Approximately 500 beats of the patients heart rate will be analysed by the computer and the doctor will then interpret the results.</p>
