<h2>What Is Autism?</h2>
<p>Autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder that affects the way a person communicates and relates to people around them. Children with autism have triad of impairments in social interaction, social communication and imagination. They are also likely to have stereotypic or ritualistic behaviour and sensory difficulties. These children tend to have learning difficulties and many of them are intellectually deficient.</p>
<p>Although all children with autism share the commonality in triad of impairment, each child is unique in their developmental, cognitive and adaptive profile. Therefore the diagnostic term &quot;<strong>autistic spectrum disorder</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>ASD</strong>&quot;is now more frequently used in clinical practice to encapsulate these variations.</p>
