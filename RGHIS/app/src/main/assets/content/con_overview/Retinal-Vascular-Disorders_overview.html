<h1 class=sectionbanner>RETINAL VASCULAR DISORDERS </h2>
<p><em>If you are experiencing blurred vision, you may be having retinal vascular disorders.</em></p>
<h2>What are Retinal Vascular Disorders?<br>
 </h2>
Retinal vascular disorders refer to a range of eye diseases that affect the blood vessels in the eye. These conditions are linked to existing vascular diseases, such as high blood pressure and artherosclerosis (thickening of the artery walls). The most common Retinal Vascular Disorders are:<br>
 <br>
 Hypertensive Retinopathy <br>
 Retinal vein occlusion (RVO)<br>
 Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)<br>
 Diabetic Retinopathy (Find out more about )<br>
<br>
High blood pressure (hypertension) causes the blood vessels in the eye to narrow, leak and harden over time as these vessels are subjected to continued excessive blood pressure. In some cases, this can cause the optic nerve to swell and result in vision problems. ()<br>

<h2>What are the risk factors for Hypertensive Retinopathy?<br>
 </h2>
Risks of hypertensive retinopathy is chronic hypertension or high blood pressure which puts the blood vessels under a prolonged state of abnormal pressure.<br>

<h2>Retinal vein occlusion (RVO)<br>
 </h2>
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is a common vascular disorder where the vein becomes narrowed or obstructed (occluded). RVO is one of the most frequent causes of blindness after . There are two main types of RVO. A Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) that happens in the retinal vein at the optic nerve is called a <strong>Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)</strong>. About 90 per cent of CRVO occurs in those aged 50 and above. An obstruction at a branch of the retinal vein is referred to as <strong>Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO)</strong>. BRVO accounts for some 30 per cent of all vein blockages.<br>

<h2>What are the risk factors of Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO)?<br>
 </h2>
Some risk factors of RVO are:
<p> Hypertension<br>
 Diabetes mellitus<br>
 Cardiovascular disorders<br>
 Bleeding or clotting disorders<br>
 Vasculitis<br>
 Autoimmune disorders<br>
 Use of oral contraceptives<br>
 Primary open-angle glaucoma or close-angle glaucoma ()</p>

<h2>What is a Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)?</h2>
A Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO) is a blockage of the central retinal artery -- the main blood vessel that brings blood and oxygen to the eye. This is a very serious condition that requires emergency treatment. When the main source of oxygen to the eye is blocked permanent damage can occur. When the blockage occurs in one of the branches of the central retinal artery, it is called a <strong>Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion (BRAO)</strong>.<br>

<h2>What are the risk factors for Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)?<br>
 </h2>
Risks of Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO) include smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, coronary heart disease + a history of stroke. About 75 per cent of CRAO cases occur in those with hypertension or blocked arteries in the heart.<br>
