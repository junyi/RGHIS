            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Procedure</span></h2>
            <p>* First, you will have an ultra-sound scan of your neck. <br>
            <br>
            * After the ultra-sound, you will be given a small injection of the tracer. <br>
            <br>
            * After about 15 minutes, a small Gamma Camera will be placed over your neck and an image of your thyroid will be recorded. This will take about 15 minutes and it is very important that you keep very still as any head movements will produced a blurred image. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
