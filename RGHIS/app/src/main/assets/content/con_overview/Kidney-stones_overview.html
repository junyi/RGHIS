            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p>The kidneys are two beanshaped organs located below your chest, one on each side of the spine. The kidneys remove extra water and wastes from the blood, producing urine. They also produce hormones and keep a stable balance of salts in the blood. Narrow tubes called ureters carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder, an oval-shaped reservoir for urine in the abdomen. </p>
            <p>A kidney stone is composed of crystals formed by chemicals that separate from the urine that builds up in the kidney.</p>
            <p>The most common type of stone contains calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate. A less common type of stone, caused by infection in the urinary tract, is called a struvite stone. Other rarer stones include uric acid stones and cystine stones.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes</span></h2>
            <p>Stones form as a result of urine with a high concentration of certain chemicals (such as calcium, oxalate, phosphate, uric acid and others) and a low concentration of substances that stop stone formation (urinary inhibitors such as citrate and magnesium).</p>
            <p>Urinary tract infections, kidney disorders such as cystic kidney diseases, and certain metabolic disorders are linked to stone formation.</p>
            <p>Calcium oxalate stones may also form in people with chronic inflammation of the bowel or have had an intestinal bypass operation, or ostomy surgery. </p>

            Risk Factors</span></h2>
            <p>Stones occur more frequently in men, and most commonly between 40 and 70 years old. Once you get more than one stone, other stones are likely to develop.</p>
