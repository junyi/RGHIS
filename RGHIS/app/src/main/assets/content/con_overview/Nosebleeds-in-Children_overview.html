            <p>Nosebleeds can be scary, but usually cause no harm to children. Children usually bleed from the superficial and thin blood vessels at the front portion of the nose on the septum, just behind the nostrils. Such nosebleeds usually decrease after puberty as the nose lining thickens from hormonal changes.</p>

            Causes</span></h2>
            <p>The most common causes of nosebleeds are : </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nose-picking  this may also increase the frequency of nosebleeds </li>
                <li>Allergies </li>
                <li>Colds </li>
                <li>Injuries </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Air-conditioning has a drying effect on the nasal lining, and increases the risk of nosebleeds. In rare instances, bleeding disorders or tumours may cause nosebleeds.</p>
