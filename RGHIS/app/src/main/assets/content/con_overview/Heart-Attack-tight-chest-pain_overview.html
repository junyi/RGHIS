            <p>The heart is a fist-size organ which lies in the centre of the chest. Its main function is to pump blood to the lungs where the blood is replenished with oxygen and then subsequently to pump blood to the rest of the body to allow it to function properly. In order for the heart itself to function properly, it receives blood rich with oxygen via blood vessels called coronary arteries.</p>

                        <p>Atherosclerosis is the process that causes gradual buildup in the inner lining of the artery and therefore narrowing of the coronary artery. Although its exact mechanism is unknown, certain factors in a person increase the likelihood of this process. These include smoking, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, cholesterol and strong family history.</p>
                        <p>When the narrowing inside the lumen of the artery is severe, the amount of blood supply is unable to meet the demand of the heart muscle, especially when the person is exerting or exercising. The condition whereby the heart muscle is starved of essential nutrient is called myocardial ischaemia. When myocardial ischaemic occurs only upon exertion, it is called angina (i.e. <strong>chest pain</strong>). Stable angina is not life threatening and is usually promptly relieved by rest to reduce heart muscle demand or medications to dilate the coronary artery to increase the blood supply.</p>
