            <p>Tennis elbow is a common condition in adults in their 40s and 50s. Known formally as lateral epicondylitis of the elbow, it is more commonly known as tennis elbow. While most commonly associated with tennis (10% to 50% of regular tennis players experience it during their playing careers), hence its name, it can occur in any sport or work that requires forceful and/or repetitive forearm usage.</p>

            <br>
            Tennis elbow occurs due to a small tear/microtear in the tendon(s) on the outside of the elbow (lateral side) that attach the forearm muscles to the elbow joint (lateral eipcondyle). Repeated tears leads to the development of damage in the tendon known as angiofi broblastic hyperplasia. The microtear and subsequent development of the damaged tissue is due to forceful and repetitive forearm use. </div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Introduction>
