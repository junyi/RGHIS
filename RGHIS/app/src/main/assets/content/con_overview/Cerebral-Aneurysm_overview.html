            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p>A <strong>cerebral (brain) aneurysm</strong> is a bulging or ballooning out of a part of a blood vessel wall due to a weak point in the latters wall. As the aneurysm grows, the vessel wall becomes thinner and weaker. It can become so thin that it spontaneously leaks or ruptures, releasing blood into the space around the brain called the subarachnoid space. This results in a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Blood can also leak into the cerebrospinal fluid (brain fluid) or into the brain substance itself, resulting in an intracerebral haematoma (blood clot). This blood can irritate, damage or destroy nearby brain cells. In more serious cases, the bleeding may cause brain damage, paralysis, coma or even death.</p>

            Causes </span></h2>
            <p><strong>Who is affected? <br>
            </strong><br>
            Aneurysms can occur in all age groups, with the peak age of presentation of a ruptured aneurysm between 50-60 years. Women have a higher incidence of this occurrence than men. </p>
            <p>The exact mechanisms by which aneurysms develop are still not fully understood. Previously thought to be congenital defects in the vessel wall, there is little evidence for such inherited weakness. It is now thought to be a degenerative condition with a number of contributory factors.</p>
