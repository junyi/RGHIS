            <p>Off-pump or beating heart surgery allows surgeons to perform surgery on the heart while it is still beating without the use of the heart-lung machine. The surgeon uses advanced operating equipment to stabilise (hold) portions of the heart and the blocked artery. Complications relating to the use of heart-lung machine can be avoided with this technique.</p>
