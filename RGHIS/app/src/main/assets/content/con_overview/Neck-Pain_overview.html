            <p><strong><em>What causes neck pain?</em></strong> </p>
            <p>Your neck contains bones, joints, tendons, ligaments, muscles and nerves. Any of these components can hurt. Pain in the jaw, head or shoulders may also spread to the neck and cause pain. Conversely, problems in your neck can also make other parts of your body hurt, such as your head, upper back, shoulders or arms. </p>
            <p>The commonest cause of neck pain is still muscle and ligament strain, especially from poor posture, or from an injury. Wear and tear from old age or arthritis can also cause neck pain.</p>
