            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Headaches</strong> occur in over 90% of school-age children and are generally not serious. It is a common symptom and in most cases, the causes are simple. It may be due to a lack of sleep, hunger or even anxiety before an exam. Children get the same types of headaches adults do, such as tension headaches and migraines. However, young children generally do not complain of headaches so any such complaints, especially if persistent or recurrent, should be taken seriously. Certain features of a headache will point to important conditions that may need urgent treatment. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes</span> </h2>
            <p>The following factors can make your child more prone to headaches: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Head injury. Accidental bumps and bruises can cause headaches. Most head injuries are minor. But seek medical help immediately if the child has been vomiting, bleeds from the nose or ears, is drowsy, walks unsteadily, loses consciousness, has a seizure, complains of blurred vision or a steadily worsening headache after a bang on the head. </li>
                <li>Illness and infection. Headache is a frequent symptom of many common childhood illnesses such as the common cold, allergic rhinitis and ear and sinus infections. </li>
                <li>Emotions. Anxiety and stress caused by problems with parents, teachers or friends can cause headaches in many children. </li>
                <li>Environment. Weather changes, loud noises, odours, and bright lights can all contribute to headaches. </li>
                <li>Genetic predisposition. If there is a family history of bad headaches, the child will have a higher risk of getting them too. This is particularly true for migraines, which tend to run in families. </li>
                <li>Rare causes: brain infection and . </li>
            </ul>

            Prevention</span></h2>
            <p>The first step to preventing headaches is to know what triggers the headache. It could be stress (from school or friends), anxiety, depression, a change in routine or sleep pattern, bright light, loud noises or certain food or beverage. Sometimes, too much physical activity or too much sun exposure can trigger migraines in children. </p>
            <p>To prevent headaches triggered by a change in lifestyle, make sure your child practise good habits such as getting enough sleep, eating healthily and exercising. </p>
            <p>Parents should also be alert for things that may cause stress in the childs life, such as problems with schoolwork or with peers. Removing the stress can help prevent your child from developing a headache. </p>
            <p>It is also good to keep a food diary so that you know what kind of food or beverage trigger headaches in your child. Make sure your child avoid those foods.</p>
