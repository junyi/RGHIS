<h2>Help Your Child Talk</h2>
<p>Learning to talk is exciting. It starts right after birth. It should be fun for your child, family and friends. But it is not necessarily easy. The process of talking involves paying attention, listening, thinking, understanding, wanting and needing to speak. It also involves taking turns, as well as being able to coordinate all the right muscles, the lips, jaw and tongue to move in the correct way in order to make words.</p>
<p>Children learn to talk at different ages. Some children utter their first intelligible word before they are one year old, while others may not speak until they are over 2. Generally, however, most children start to talk by 18 months. The purpose of verbal communication is to produce sounds and words to satisfy ones needs. The first words of a child usually serve to call the people he/she needs (e.g., 'mama, 'papa). </p>
<p>Children need to be encouraged to talk in the same way as they are encouraged to walk. Use specific praises e.g. 'Good talking!' even if they are unable to say the actual word clearly. Till the age of four, children are still in the process of learning to articulate speech sounds accurately. And remember, children can understand what is being said long before they can use the words themselves.</p>
<h2>12 Tips to Talking</h2>
<p>The following are some ways in which you can help your child learn to talk. Be patient. The process is gradual and may seem slow. Words may be unclear and your child may stumble or hesitate.</p>
<ol class=contentpage>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px">Use short phrases when talking to your child when you are playing together  toddlers often have a difficult time isolating a word from a long paragraph. Try to repeat single words and short phrases. </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px">Have fun with nursery rhymes and songs, especially those with actions. </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px">Encourage your child to listen to different sounds (e.g. animals, aeroplanes, the doorbell). </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px">Gain your childs attention when you talk to him. Get down to his level, face-to-face. Encourage him to look at you or at the object that you are talking about by holding the toy/object next to your face when youre labelling it. </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px">Encourage your child to communicate in other ways, not just through words. Use gestures and pictures. Similarly, respond to your childs gestures. If your child reaches for an object, pick it up and hand it to him/her while saying the word. Gradually, delay the time you take to respond to your child and encourage him/her to request for the object verbally. </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px">Give your child choices (e.g. 'Do you want an orange or a banana?'). </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px">Talk about things as they happen (e.g. when changing him, watching television, unpacking the shopping). </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px">Listen carefully and give your child time to finish whatever he is saying. Take turns to speak. </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px">Give your child opportunities to talk. Praise your child for all his/her attempts to communicate. You can say, 'Good talking.' and respond to his/her speech appropriately by giving him an item requested, responding to his question or comment, etc. </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px">Help your child to use more words by adding onto what he is saying.<br>
    For example:<br>
    Child: 'Ball.'<br>
    Adult: 'Ball. Throw ball!' </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px">If your child says something incorrectly, say it back the correct way. However, do not force your child to repeat the word(s).<br>
    For example:<br>
    Child: 'PiРІР‚В¦'<br>
    Adult: 'Yes, fish.' </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size:11px">Dedicate a special time with your child each day to play with toys and read picture books together. </span></li>
</ol>
<h3>RememberРІР‚В¦</h3>
