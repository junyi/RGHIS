            <p>Coronary Angioplasty is a minimally invasive, non-surgical procedure used to open narrowed arteries. It involves the use of a flexible catheter with a balloon at the tip which is inflated at high pressure on the narrowed arterial wall. Usually a stent (metallic wire mesh) will be placed in the artery after angioplasty. This will force the arterial plaque against the blood vessel and improve the blood flow to the heart muscle.</p>

                        <p>A small puncture is made, usually in the groin, wrist or elbow. A sheath is inserted into the opening and a guiding catheter is placed through the sheath into the blood vessel. Contrast is injected through the catheter so that the doctor can see the arteries on the X-ray screen. Once the catheter reached the narrowed artery, the doctor will position the balloon within the blocked section of the artery. The balloon is then inflated to squash the blockage so that blood flow can be restored to normal.</p>

            <p>You are required to go for pre-admission testing which includes: <br>
            - Blood sampling for urea, serum electrolytes, glucose and creatinine<br>
            - Full blood count<br>
            - Prothrombin Time/Partial Thromboplastin Time<br>
            - Hepatitis B screening<br>
            - Chest radiograph (X-ray)<br>
            - 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) </p>
            <p>You will be asked if you have any allergic reactions to medicines or food, especially to X-ray contrast or iodine compounds. You are advised to inform the doctor of your allergies. </p>

            <p>You will be nursed in the High Dependency Unit (HDU), Intermediate Care Area (ICA) or in the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) where you will be observed for bleeding, heart rhythm disturbances and complications that may occur in the period immediately following the coronary angioplasty. </p>
            <p>A nurse will frequently check your pulse, blood pressure, and observe the procedure site for bleeding. Patients are usually discharged from the hospital within two to four days. </p>
