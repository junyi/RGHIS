            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p>The Auditory-Verbal approach helps children with hearing impairment learn to listen. Their speech and language skills are allowed to develop in a natural way following normal developmental stages.<br>
            <br>
            The goal is for children who are deaf or hard of hearing to develop to their full potential in regular classrooms and living environments, and hence to function independently in mainstream society.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><em><span class=text><strong><em>Who can benefit from Auditory-Verbal Therapy?<br>
            </em></strong></span></em></strong><span class=text><br>
            Children with all degrees of hearing impairment, from mild to profound who are currently using hearing-aids and/or a cochlear implant have the opportunity to learn to listen and develop spoken language through the Auditory-Verbal approach. </span></p>
            <p><em><span class=text><em><strong>What is the best age for a child to start Auditory-Verbal Therapy?</strong><br>
            </em></span></em><br>
            <span class=text>Therapy can begin as soon as a child, even an infant, has been fitted with hearing aids. Because the human brain develops most rapidly in infancy, therapy and parent teaching should start immediately during this crucial period.</span></p>

            <p>Children and their parents participate together in regular, diagnostic, individualised sessions. Parents learn how to create a listening environment through play and daily routines with their children.</p>
