            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview </span></h2>
            <p>Rectal prolapse is a condition in which the rectum (the lower end of the colon, located just above the anus) drops downwards and turns inside out. In the early stage, the rectum stays inside the body, but as the condition worsens, it may protrude out through the anus. There is often weakness of the anal muscles, and this may result in leakage of stool or mucus. Rectal prolapse is more common in women than men. </p>
            <p><strong><em>Is Rectal Prolapse The Same As Hemorrhoids?</em></strong> <br>
            <br>
            They may have the same symptoms such as bleeding and/or a lump that protrudes from the anus. Rectal prolapse, however, involves a part of the intestines higher up within the body, while hemorrhoids develop near the anal opening. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes</span></h2>
            <p>Several factors contribute to the development of rectal prolapse. Repeated straining at stools or stresses during childbirth plays a role. With aging, there is weakening of the tissues that support the rectum and weakening of the muscles of the anus. In some cases, neurological problems, such as spinal cord injury or spinal cord disease, can lead to prolapse. In most cases, however, no single cause can be identified.</p>
