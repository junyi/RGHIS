<h2>Expected Course</h2>
<p>Only bacterial pneumonia is helped by antibiotics. As it is difficult to distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia in all cases, antibiotics are sometimes prescribed for children who have viral pneumonia. With a course of appropriate antibiotics, the fever should settle within 48 to 72 hours from the start of the antibiotics. The coughing may take longer, up to 2 weeks, to resolve. However, severe cases of pneumonia will need to be admitted to hospital for injection antibiotics.</p>
