            <p>A valve is a structure in the body that allows fluid to move along the body. The main heart valves are the aortic, pulmonary, tricuspid and mitral valves. These valves work in coordinated movements, so that while the mitral and tricuspid valves open to allow blood to flow into the heart for example, the aortic and pulmonary valves remain closed. This ensures one-directional blood flow for proper blood circulation. </p>

            <p>Valves that are not functioning correctly can either be repaired or replaced. Examples of a valve not functioning correctly are when it is stenotic (narrowed) or incompetent (leaky), causing blood to leak back into the heart when it should flow out of the heart. Valves that are not repaired lead to heart disease and mortality. </p>
            <p>Valve repair (also called valvuplasty) allows the surgeon to fix a faulty valve, often without the use of artificial parts. The mitral valve is the most commonly repaired valve, but the aortic and tricuspid valves may also undergo some of these repair techniques. During surgical repair of valve defects, such as mitral incompetence, the surgeon reconstructs the valve so that it can close properly. Only some damaged valves may be repaired. </p>
            <p>If the valves are severely damaged, replacement of the valve will be necessary. The replacement is from an artificial valve and can be made of metal, plastic, or a biologic material made from animal tissue. </p>

            <p>Patients benefiting from valve repair and replacement are those suffering from valvular heart disease. The advantages of valve repair are:<br>
- lower risk of infection <br>
- decreased need for life-long blood thinner medication <br>
- preserved heart muscle strength <br>
- reduced risk of stroke and increased long-term survival</p>
