<p>TEARING DISORDERS</p>

<p><em>Watery eyes and an overproduction of tears can be due to a blockage of the tear ducts</em></p>
<h2>What are Tearing Disorders?</h2>
<p>  <br>
 <br>
Tears are produced constantly by the lacrimal gland which is located under the upper eyelid. Tears are essential because they form a thin film that coats the front surface of the eye and prevents it from becoming dry. Normally, tears are quickly drained from the eye through a complex system of channels that lead from the inner corner of the eyelids into the nose. This system of channels is called the lacrimal drainage system. A disturbance of this equilibrium is seen in tearing disorders. Frequently, obstruction of the drainage system is the reason for excessive tearing.</p>

<h2>What causes excessive tearing?</h2>
<p>Tears are normally drained quickly from the eye. Blockage of the lacrimal drainage system is an important cause of excessive tearing and tends to occur in older people. It is believed that the blockage is due to involutional narrowing of the nasolacrimal duct. <br>
<br>
Any ocular irritation due to a variety of causes can also cause overproduction of tears and excessive tearing.  Dry eyes can sometimes set off reflex tearing and result in occasional bouts of tearing.</p>
