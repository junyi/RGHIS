            <p><strong>Patellar Tendinitis<br>
            <br>
            </strong>Patellar tendinitis is an injury that affects the tendon connecting your kneecap (patella) to your shinbone. The patellar tendon helps your muscles extend your lower leg so that you can kick a ball, pedal your bicycle and jump up in the air.</p>

            Commonly known as jumper's knee, patellar tendinitis is most common in athletes whose sports involve frequent jumping, running or kicking. <br>
            <br>
            Patellar tendinitis is a common overuse injury as a result of repeated stress on your patellar tendon. The stress results in tears in the tendon that as they become more numerous, causes inflammation in your tendon. </div>
