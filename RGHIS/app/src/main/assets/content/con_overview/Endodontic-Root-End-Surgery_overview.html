        Root canal treatment aims to eliminate bacteria and disinfect the tooth. However, as the structure of the root canal system can be very complex, removing bacteria to harbour despite the best efforts to clean them out, giving them rise to persistent infection later. <br>
        <br>
        Uncontrolled decay, cracks or defective restorations may also affet the root filling, eventually causing the root canals to be re-infected. Some cysts at the root end may not heal even with root canal treatment. <br>

        Commonly referred to as apicoectomy or root-end resection, it involves removing the infected root tip and the surrounding infection or inflammed tissues. This is done in a surgical setting with the aid of a microscope. After local anaesthetic is administrated, the gum is lifted to expose the bone and tooth beneath. The root and its surrounding area will be inspected especially for the presence of any cracks or fractures. Curretage and disinfection are then carried out. If necessary, diseased tissues are removed and sent for biopsy. The affected root tip is then cut away, the apical root canal is re-sealed with a root-end filling and the gums are stitched back. <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes, when the affected root or tooth is deemed beyond surgical repair or treatment, it may be extracted during the same surgery. <br>

        Under local aneathetic, generally no pain is experienced during surgery. However, there may be some pain, tenderness and bruising of the affected area after surgery when the anaesthetic wears off. Painkillers, antibiotics and mouth wash may be prescribed to alleviate these symptoms. <br>
