            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p>Our gastrointestinal tract is made up of many different parts, each with its own unique function. Here is an overview of the normal functions of our gastrointestinal tract </p>
            <p><strong><em>Mouth:</em></strong> Apart from providing the pleasure of eating, the function of the mouth is to help in the chewing of food so that it can be broken into smaller pieces for swallowing and digestion.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Oesophagus/ gullet</em></strong>: The gullet is a muscular tube of approximately 25 cm in length. It delivers food into our stomachs by relaxing its muscular sphincter at lower end. It usually prevents reflux of acid from the stomach back into the gullet through contraction. In some people, this sphincter can become weakened thus allowing the free flow of acid into the gullet causing inflammation. This condition is more prone in obesity and by alcohol, nicotine and fatty food. Sufferers experience pain at the upper abdomen and heartburn. </p>
            <p><strong><em>Stomach</em></strong>: The stomach can be considered as a muscular sac which performs the following functions: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Mixing of foods ( as a blender ) </li>
                <li>Reservoir and gatekeeper to control for food delivery into our small bowel for digestion. </li>
                <li>Secretion of acid to help digestion of protein. </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong><em>Small intestine</em></strong>: It is 1.5 metre in length with the primary function of digestion of food. Its internal surface area is increased by numerous folds in order to increase the surface area for absorption of nutrients. Protein, fat and carbohydrate molecules are broken down into smaller fragments so they can be easily transported across the small bowel wall and into the blood stream and lymphatic system. This process is called digeston. As much as 9 litre of water can be absorbed across the small bowel per day. Vitamins and minerals such as iron are also absorbed by the small bowel.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Pancreas:</em></strong> This is a gland that sits below the stomach. It secretes enzymes into the small bowel wall which helps in breaking down protein, fat and sugar into smaller frgaments. It also secretes the hormone insulin into our blood stream which maintains sugar level. </p>
            <p><strong><em>Gallbladder:</em></strong> For storage of bile made by liver. Bile salts helps to digest fat. When food bolus arrives into the small bowel, gallbladders will be stimulated to contract thus emptying bile into the small bowel to help with digestion. We can however live without our gallbladders ( as happened to people who have their gallbadders removed due to stones ) though we shall become intolerant of fatty food.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Colon (large bowel):</em></strong> the large bowel starts from the small bowel and ends at the rectum. The rectum is about 12 cm long and joins the anus. It absorbs up to 3 litre of water daily. Its resident bacteria population digest food components such as roughage and fibre which are not digested by the small bowel. Anal canal has muscular sphincter which controls defaecation. Entry of faeces into the rectum causes relaxation of the muscular sphincter and at the appropriate social situations, the rectum can be emptied by contraction of abdominal muscular wall and relaxation of anal sphincter. </p>
            <p><strong><em>Liver:</em></strong> The liver is the largest organ in the human body and performs some of the most complex functions. It receives 25% of blood supply at any one time and weighs about 1.5 kg. Its functions are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Synthesis of proteins, antibody and fats. </li>
                <li>With the help of insulin, it controls sugar level. </li>
                <li>It detoxifies many drugs and alcohol. </li>
                <li>It acts as a sieve to 'trap' bacteria that have gained access into the body through the bowel wall. </li>
            </ol>
