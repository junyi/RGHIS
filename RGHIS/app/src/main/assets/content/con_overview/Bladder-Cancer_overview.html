            <p><strong>What is Bladder Cancer?<br>
            </strong><br>
             The bladder is a hollow muscular organ that lies in the area surrounded by the hipbones, an area called the pelvis. The bladder acts as a reservoir to collect urine from the kidneys. The muscles of the bladder help to pass out urine from the lower urinary passage (urethra). The cells lining the bladder can develop abnormally and result in bladder cancer. </p>
