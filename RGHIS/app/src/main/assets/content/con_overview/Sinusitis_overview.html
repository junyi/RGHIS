            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p>Sinuses are naturally occurring airfi lled spaces in the skull. Each sinus is covered with a mucosal covering. The sinuses are all connected to the nose and mucus produced in the sinuses naturally drain out through the nose. <br>
            <br>
            In sinusitis, the mucous membranes become inflamed and swollen. This obstructs the flow of mucus out of the sinuses and leads to build-up of mucus in the sinuses leading to sinusitis.</p>

            Causes</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Viruses </strong>are the most common cause of sinusitis and these infections usually resolve fairly quickly with just symptomatic treatment. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Bacterial</strong> sinusitis usually has a longer duration of symptoms and may be treated with oral antibiotics. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Fungal</strong> sinusitis is the least common of the three and usually occurs in those with a weakened immune system. Some pre-existing conditions may make an individual more likely to suffer from sinusitis, these include anatomical abnormalities of the nose, uncontrolled allergic rhinitis, and those with depressed immunity and some tooth infections.</p>

            Complications</span></h2>
            <p>Occasionally, complications may arise from untreated sinusitis. This occurs when the infection spreads. These complications include meningitis, infections to the eye and worsening of pre-existing asthma.</p>
