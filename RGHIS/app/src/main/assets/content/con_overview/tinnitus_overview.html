            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p>Tinnitus is the perception of sounds not generated in the external environment. It is common and many people will experience it at some point in their lives. </p>
            <p>People with tinnitus often describe the sound as ringing, buzzing, swishing or clicking.While it can be disturbing to someone who has it, for many with tinnitus it is not a serious problem. Some, however, may require medical or surgical treatment. </p>
            <p><strong><span style="color:#ff6600">Types of Tinnitus </span></strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Subjective tinnitus:</strong> The most common variety of tinnitus. Only you can hear the sound.These include the sounds of crickets, roaring, buzzing, hissing, whistling and high-pitched ringing. </li>
                <li><strong>Objective tinnitus:</strong> This sound can be heard by yourself as well as the doctor. It is less common and makes up less than 5% of cases. </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong><span style="color:#ff6600">Prevalence </span></strong></p>
            <p>Tinnitus is very common and many people will experience it at some point.Studies show that up to 10-15% of the population suffers tinnitus severe enough to seek medical attention.The prevalence increases with age. More men than women are affected. </p>

            Causes</span></h2>
            <p>Tinnitus, itself, is not a disease but may be a sign of damage in the hearing system or brain. </p>
            <p><strong>Hearing loss</strong> is the most common cause of tinnitus. Hearing loss can be due to normal ageing or trauma to the cochlea (the hearing organ) through noise, drugs, or chemicals. It has been suggested that because the cochlea is no longer sending normal signals to the brain, the brain develops its own noise to make up for the lack of normal sound signals.This is interpreted as sound - tinnitus. </p>
            <p><strong>Loud noise exposure</strong> damages the hearing and is a common cause of tinnitus. Many people are unaware and unconcerned about the harmful effects of excessively loud noise at discos or from using earphones. </p>
            <p><strong>Anything that affects our hearing,</strong> such as an ear infection or excess wax in the ear can make tinnitus worse. </p>
            <p><strong><span style="color:#ff6600">Subjective tinnitus</span></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Menieres disease</strong> is a common cause of subjective tinnitus. Someone suffering from this complains of fullness in the ear or hearing loss, roaring tinnitus and dizziness that can ast for hours. </p>
            <p><strong>Acoustic neuroma</strong> is a rare cause of subjective tinnitus. It is a tumour that grows on the nerve that leads from the brain to the inner ear.The affected person usually notices the tinnitus and hearing loss in one ear, unlike the more common type caused by hearing loss that is usually felt in both ears. </p>
            <p><strong>Drugs </strong>such as aspirin (if overused) and some antibiotics are also other causes of tinnitus. </p>
            <p><strong><span style="color:#ff6600">Objective tinnitus </span></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Blood flow,</strong> either through normal or abnormal blood vessels near the ear is usually the cause of objective tinnitus. Causes of pulsatile tinnitus (tinnitus that corresponds to the heartbeat) include pregnancy, anaemia, an overactive thyroid gland, or tumours involving blood vessels near the ear (glomus tumour and arteriovenous malformation). </p>
            <p><strong>The narrowing of the carotid artery</strong> (a major blood vessel to the brain) can also cause pulsatile tinnitus. </p>
            <p><strong>Benign intracranial hypertension,</strong> a condition where an increase in the pressure of the fluid surrounding the brain causes pulsatile tinnitus. </p>
            <p><strong>Jaw joint misalignment problems or muscles of the ear or throat 'twitching</strong> can cause clicking types of tinnitus. </p>
