            <p><strong>During the Intravenous Urography Examination</strong> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Before the examination starts, you will be asked to empty your bladder. In the examination room, you will be lying down on the x-ray couch. </li>
                <li>During the examination, the radiologist will give you an injection at the forearm. The injection contains a special drug (contrast medium) that allows the urinary system to be clearly seen on x-ray films. </li>
                <li>There is a possible risk that some patients may experience allergic reaction to the dye (contrast medium) after injection. If you felt nauseous, ill or developed rashes after the injection, please immediately inform the radiographer who attends to you </li>
                <li>A compression belt is also placed over the abdomen and is tightened after the injection. The belt is needed to assess the functioning of the kidneys. A slight discomfort is normally expected from the compression of the belt. The compression will be removed at a later stage of the examination. </li>
                <li>Throughout the examination, several x-ray images will be taken. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The entire examination may take 1-2 hours.Due to the nature of our work, some examinations may take longer than anticipated and we may not be able to keep strictly to schedule.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Possible Risks</span></h2>
            <p>As with all procedures involving ionizing radiation, a radiation risk applies. However, the benefits of an accurate diagnosis far outweigh the risks. <br>
            Contrast materials used in IVU studies can cause adverse reactions in some people. However, our radiographers and radiologists are well-trained to deal with such reactions.</p>
