            <p>Coronary artery disease is the narrowing or blockage of the artery or arteries supplying blood to the heart muscle. This narrowing is caused by plaques, which are cholesterol deposits on the vessel wall, resulting in abnormal and gradual thickening of the lining of the heart arteries (a condition known as atherosclerosis). The narrowing usually develops slowly over many years.</p>

            <p>Patients who smoke, or have conditions such as diabetes mellitus,  and high blood cholesterol or fat levels are prone to developing coronary artery disease.</p>
            <p>The heart has three main coronary arteries. Patients are said to have single, double, or triple-vessel disease, depending on the number of vessels that are narrowed. When the narrowing becomes critical, the patient can develop symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath. In medical terms, this is called angina.</p>
            <p>The cholesterol plaque causing the blockage can sometimes rupture suddenly, causing a blood clot to form. This blood clot will cut off blood supply and cause damage to the heart muscle. This is called myocardial infarction, commonly known as a ''. The patient may get severe chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, giddiness, cold sweaty hands, and even die suddenly.</p>
            <p>The severity and prognosis of the heart attack depend on the percentage of the heart muscle damaged. Minor heart attacks usually recover. Major heart attacks can result in long-term heart failure, enlargement of the heart, , heart valve leakage and even death.</p>
