            <p><strong>The Knee<br>
            </strong><br>
            The knee is a complex joint that connects the thigh with the lower leg. The knee joint and its ligaments permit flexion, extension, and in certain positions, medial and lateral rotation. It is a common site for sprain and dislocation.</p>
            <p><strong>Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries</strong><br>
            The Anterior Cruciate Ligament or ACL is often injured in sports such as football or skiing. A twist, a direct blow or a fall may easily tear the ligaments. These tearing of the ligaments result in pain and swelling, as well as instability of the knee. You will feel that your knee is giving way, especially when trying to change direction on the knee. </p>
            <p>By treating the instability and performing a reconstruction of the ligaments, the risk of developing wear and tear in the knee can be reduced. </p>
            <p><strong>What is Anterior Curiate Ligament (ACL) Surgery?</strong><br>
            Your surgeon can reconstruct a damaged ACL. This can be done by replacing the damaged tissue with a healthy strong tissue (a graft) taken from an area near your knee. This operation is called ACL Reconstruction. </p>
            <p>Today, this surgery is most often done using the arthroscope. Two or more incisions will be made to your knee. An arthroscope will be inserted at one of the incision to look into the knee. Some other fine instruments will also be inserted to repair any damages found. </p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Preparation Before Surgery</span></h2>
            <p>You will be admitted to hospital either a day before the surgery, or on the day of the surgery. If you have additional medical problems, admission may even be earlier. </p>
            <p><strong>Physical Assessment</strong><br>
            A physiotherapist will perform a physical assessment to establish a baseline of your knee range of motion, and strength status before the surgery.</p>
            <p><strong>No Smoking</strong><br>
            We strongly discourage smoking one week prior to surgery, and especially on the night before the surgery. Smoking makes it difficult for you to clear your secretions after surgery, and may impede your recovery. </p>
            <p><strong>No Food Consumption</strong><br>
            You must not consume any food, not even water, after midnight. This is to prevent any vomiting and subsequent inhaling of the vomitus into the lung during surgery, which could be life-threatening. </p>
            <p><strong>Get a Good Nights Rest</strong><br>
            Have a good nights sleep before your operation. Do let your doctor or nurse know if you require some medication to help you to sleep.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal Items &amp; Valuables</strong><br>
            We advise that you leave all your valuables and personal items at home, and to keep not more than ten dollars with you during your stay in the hospital.</p>
