<h2>Fever In Children</h2>
<p>The human body has a thermostat which helps us to regulate our body temperature. The normal body temperature is between 36.5Р’В°C and 37.5Р’В°C. With infection or other illnesses, various chemicals are released in our body. This re-adjusts the thermostat, resulting in fever.</p>
<p>A few points to note about fever:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fever is the body's way to fight infection. However, it is not just caused by infections alone. </li>
    <li>How high a fever is does not indicate the severity of the illness that is causing the fever. </li>
    <li>Over-wrapping and a generally hot environment can cause the body temperature of a child to be slightly above normal. </li>
    <li class=last>Fever caused by viral infections may persist for up to 5 to 7 days and will only completely settle when the viral fever has resolved. </li>
</ul>
