<h1 class=sectionbanner>ENTROPION</h2>
<p><em>Do your eyelashes or eyelids turn inwards and cause irritation to your eyes? The problem could be inverted eyelids (Entropion) - a condition that causes eye discomfort, inflammation and infection.</em></p>
<h2>What is Entropion?<br>
 </h2>
Entropion refers to the condition where the eyelid margin rolls inward towards the eye. As a result, the eyelashes constantly rub against the cornea (the front transparent part of the eye) and the conjunctiva (the membrane that lines the eye), sometimes damaging these structures. The lower eyelid is most commonly involved.  <br>

<h2>What causes Entropion?</h2>
<p>The most common cause of entropion is ageing - tissues that support the lower eyelid become lax. This results in the inward rolling of the eyelid margin. Occasionally, the condition is due to scarring of the inner surface of the eyelid, caused by inflammation, chronic infections or trauma.</p>
<p>Longstanding, uncorrected entropion can lead to gradual scarring of the cornea, as well as increase the risk of infection of the cornea. It is thus important to have this condition repaired before these complications permanently reduce vision. If entropion is present in an eye requiring cataract removal, it is advisable to correct the lid abnormality first, before cataract surgery.</p>
