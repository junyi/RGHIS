            <p>Muscle tension dysphonia refers to hoarseness and difficulty in using the voice due to excessive tightness or imbalance of the muscles in and around the voice box. It can be due to habitual misuse of the voice muscles or can result from voice muscles trying to compensate for an underlying inflammatory or neurological condition, or growth on the vocal fold.</p>
