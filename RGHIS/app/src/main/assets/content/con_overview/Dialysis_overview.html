            <p>Dialysis refers to an artificial means of removal of the waste substances from the body using a specialised membrane. </p>
            <p>There are two forms namely hemodialysis or blood dialysis, and peritoneal dialysis.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Procedure</span></h2>
            <p><strong>In hemodialysis</strong>, a mechanised blood pump is needed to draw blood from the patient. The blood is circulated into the machine and passes along a specialized membrane (a dialyser) which in essence functions as an artificial kidney. Waste substances from the blood move across the membrane into the solution called a dialysate by a physical process called diffusion. The cleaned blood exits the dialyser and is returned back to the patient. </p>
            <p>In hemodialysis, the patient needs to have a surgically created vein that is large enough and with a high enough blood flow to allow efficient and adequate dialysis. The surgeon will create this specialised vein called an arterio-venous fistula or access by connecting 2 blood vessels together. Usually the operation is done at the wrist initially but other sites along the arm can also be chosen. Sometimes patients' veins are too small for such surgery. Under these circumstances, the surgeon may create the access by placing a graft that is essentially functions as an artificial blood vessel that connects two adjacent vessels. This artificial graft is left permanently under the skin of the patient and is repeatedly needled for dialysis. </p>
            <p><strong>In peritoneal dialysis</strong>, the lining of the abdomen has a membrane that can similarly function like a dialyser membrane. This lining is used as the artificial kidney in peritoneal dialysis. In peritoneal dialysis, a permanent tube (called a tenchkoff catheter) is placed under sterile conditions into the abdominal cavity. Specialized fluid called a dialysate is placed into the abdomen. The waste substances present in the blood flowing through the blood vessels of the abdomen itself move across this membrane into the dialysate. The dialysate is then removed, discarded, and a fresh bag of dialysate placed back into the abdomen to continue dialysis.</p>

            <p>Both haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) can effectively remove waste products from patients. Both however cannot entirely replace the kidney function. Apart from removal of waste products, the normal kidneys also produce substances called hormones, of which the two major ones are erythropoietin and vitamin D. Erythropoetin is essential in maintaining appropriate levels of blood counts in the body. In renal disease, the amount of erythropoetin progressively lessens, and the patient develops the problem of anemia, which essentially is a problem of low blood counts. The kidney also produces Vitamin D. Vitamin D is a hormone that works on the bone and intestine to maintain an appropriate level of calcium for the body. Calcium is essential in maintaining the health of bones and teeth. As with erythropoetin, vitamin D likewise becomes progressively reduced in quantity as the kidneys fail. The bones become brittle and prone to injury. The artificial kidneys used in both HD and PD are unable to produce the hormones like the normal kidney. Because of this, these hormones need to given in the forms of injections or oral medication to patients with renal disease.</p>
