            <p>Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring is a test where your blood pressure and heart rate are taken at a fixed time interval for 24 hours while you carry on with your daily activities. </p>
            <p>Our blood pressure (BP) watch is a simple and convenient device used over a 24-hour period.</p>

            <p><span style="color:#333333">This is an elaborate test which requires precision calibration and measurements when putting on the BP watch. Before the test starts, the medical technologist will first take your height and weight to determine your Body Mass Index (BMI). The medical technologist will then proceed to use a conventional blood pressure machine to take 3 readings to determine an average blood pressure. This is followed by measuring the size of the wrist to provide the correct strap size for the watch. <br>
            <br>
            The medical technologist will then proceed to feel for the pulse on your wrist. Once the pulse is found, the staff will strap the BP watch on your wrist and connect it to the computer to obtain an average arterial pulse wave form. When the calibrated reading is obtained, the watch is programmed to start its 24-hour monitoring and the technologist will do a marking on your wrist.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color:#333333">During this monitoring period, you are not allowed to remove the watch. However, if the watch is moved away from its original position, please adjust it back to the markings on your wrist. The BP watch will also alert you (3 beeps) before taking each BP measurement. Each measurement takes about 12-15 seconds. </span></p>
            <p><span style="color:#333333">In order to achieve higher success data return rate, it is recommended you sleep on the side without the BP watch and rest the hand with BP watch on a pillow while sleeping. If recordings are insufficient (less than 50%), you will need to repeat the test.</span></p>

            <p>There are no risks involved. BP watch is generally well tolerated but some people may develop rashes or blisters on the areas in direct contact with the watch strap.</p>
