            <p>Echocardiogram is a diagnostic procedure using high frequency sound waves (ultrasound) to take moving pictures of the heart and its related structures (e.g. valves). The pictures or images appearing on the screen may be in black and white or colour.</p>
            <p>From these pictures, we can measure the size and function of heart chambers, study the motion of heart valves, and evaluate the blood flow pattern across the valves and within the heart chambers.</p>
            <p>These information and pictures are helpful to your doctor in determining how well your heart is working and whether there are any abnormalities.</p>

                        <p>The test is performed by a trained medical technologist or doctor and will be subsequently reviewed by a doctor trained in echocardiography.</p>
                        <p>As the examination involves placing a transducer on the chest wall, you will be required to change into a hospital gown. You are required to remove only the top part of your clothes (including your bra for the ladies). <br>
                        <br>
                        We will apply water soluble gel onto the chest wall to enhance the picture quality. The room light will be dimmed to reduce glare and improve the viewing of the pictures. You will be informed if there is a need for an injection during the test. This is usually done if there is a suspicion of a hole in the heart<br>
                        <br>
                        The examination may take approximately 30 to 45 minutes, excluding waiting time.</p>

            <p>There is no known harmful or proven adverse effect from echocardiogram and can be performed repeatedly. There is also no known danger to either the pregnant mother or the foetus.</p>
            <p>This test is similar to the ultrasound test that pregnant mothers undergo. </p>
