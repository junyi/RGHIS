            <p>The prevalence of erectile dysfunction is higher in men with heart and vascular disease due to the presence of a range of risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis and smoking. These factors account for about 70% of ED causes. Between 35% and 50% of men with diabetes experience ED.<br>
            <br>
            Some of the medicines such as anti-depressants, beta-blockers and diuretics may aggravate ED as well. Any heart disease patient who has ED (or sexual problems) should consult a physician.<br>
            <br>
            Sexual dysfunction can also occur in females and there are multiple causes for it. </p>
