            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p>The prostate is a plum-sized gland located in front of the rectum and just below your bladder, where urine is stored. The prostate gland surrounds the urethra, which is the canal through which urine passes out of your body. The urethra also secretes fluid that forms part of semen.</p>
            <p>The prostate gland often enlarges with age. This condition is known as benign prostatic enlargement (BPE), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or benign prostatic hypertrophy. As the prostate enlarges, its capsule (layer of tissue surrounding it) stops it from expanding outwards. This causes the prostate gland to press inwards against the urethra like a clamp on a garden hose. </p>
            <p>As a result, the bladder wall thickens and the bladder contracts even with small amounts of urine, causing more frequent urination. Eventually, the bladder weakens and loses the ability to empty itself, resulting in residual urine left in the bladder.</p>

            Causes</span></h2>
            <p>BPE occurs because of a complex interaction between the male hormone dihydroxytestosterone (DHT - active component of testosterone), small amounts of oestrogen (female hormone), and other growth factors. This results in an imbalance of cell growth and death, and subsequent prostate growth and enlargement.</p>

            Risk Factors</span></h2>
            <p>Increasing age is a risk factor for BPE. There is no convincing evidence that your diet or lifestyle are risk factors for the condition.</p>
