            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Breast Biopsy and MIS Procedures</span></h2>
            <p>Suspicious breast lesions can be biopsied via minimally invasive techniques without the need for open surgery under general anaesthesia. These include ultrasound, mammographic as well as MRI guided core biopsy which can be vacuum assisted (Mammotome). Benign breast lesions may also be removed completely via this method.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Gastrointestinal MIS Procedures </span></h2>
            <p><strong>Laparoscopic surgery</strong>, the MIS procedure in the abdominal cavity, is the most common form of MIS performed and is used for many gastrointestinal conditions.<br>
            <br>
            It involves making tiny openings of 0.5 to 1 cm in the skin of the abdomen. A laparoscope (tiny telescope) connected to a special fibre-optic camera, which transmits a picture of the abdominal organs on a video monitor, is inserted through a cannula (a small hollow tube) usually at the umbilicus.<br>
            <br>
            Other tubes are inserted through various openings in the abdomen for special instruments to perform the surgery. The surgery is done while viewing the video screen. This allows for the same result as open surgery but with the least possible damage to the body structures.</p>

                        <br>
                        The standard treatment for <strong>Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease</strong> (GERD) and hiatus hernias (herniation of the stomach into the chest) is laparoscopic fundoplication. In this procedure, the fundus (upper part) of the stomach is wrapped around the lower portion of the oesophagus and stitched in place. This surgery prevents stomach acid from flowing back into the oesophagus, preventing GERD. <br>
                        <br>
                        <em>With this procedure, about 5 abdominal incisions of 0.5 to 1 cm are used.</em></div>
