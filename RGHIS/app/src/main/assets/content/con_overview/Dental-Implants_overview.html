A dental implant is essentially a substitute for a missing tooth root. It is commonly cylinder or screw shaped. Each implant is carefully and precisely drilled into the location of the intended tooth and provides a foundation for long-term support of replacement teeth.<br>
<br>
Almost all dental implants in use today are made from titanium alloy. These materials have been shown to be well-tolerated by bone. The terms 'osseointegrated implants and 'endosseous implants are widely used to describe dental implants that can develop and maintain a close union with bone in order to support replacement teeth. <br>

Implants can be used to replace a single tooth, multiple missing teeth or to replace teeth in cases with complete tooth loss. Therefore almost any situation can potentially be treated with this modality. However, various factors need to be taken into consideration such as a bone volume and quality, tooth and jaw relationships, oral habits and general medical health. Your dental surgeon will assess your suitability for treatment with these implants. <br>
