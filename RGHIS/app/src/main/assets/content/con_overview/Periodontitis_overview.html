<p><span style="color:#666666;line-height:18px">Advanced gum disease is called Periodontitis. It is a chronic bacterial infection of the gums and the bone supporting the teeth. It can affect one tooth or several teeth and if left untreated, may lead to bone loss. Periodontitis is a progression of gingivitis.<br>

<strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Causes</span></strong><br>
Inflammation of the gums caused by toxins from plaque, which left untreated, will progress to Periodontitis. 
<br><br>
The gums start to pull away from the teeth, forming a 'pocket'. As the plaque spreads and grows beneath the gum line, the body's immune system fights the bacteria. Bacterial toxins and the body's response to the infection break down the bone and connective tissue that hold teeth in place.<br>
<br>
If left untreated, the bones, gums and connective tissue are destroyed. The teeth may eventually become loose and have to be removed. Periodontitis can range from mild to moderate to even severe forms.
<br><br>
You may experience some or all of these symptoms:
<ul>
    <li>Bleeding gums when brushing </li>
    <li>Red, swollen, puffy-looking or tender gums </li>

<strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Prevention</span></strong><br>

<span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px"><strong>Non Surgical Treatment of Periodontitis</strong></span><br>
Scaling and root planing is a procedure of deep-cleaning the gums and surrounding tissues. <br>The procedure involves,
<ul>
    <li>scraping off the tartar from above and below the gum line </li>
    <li>using special instruments to remove tough calculus and bacteria deposits along the root surfaces under local anaesthesia </li>
</ul>
After root planing, as your gums heal, a little of the root surface may be exposed. This may cause a temporary sensitivity to cold food/drinks. If this occurs, your dentist can recommend you a toothpaste for sensitive teeth. can use atoothpaste for sensitive teeth.<br>
