<h2>Learning</h2>
<h2>Making the Difference in Helping Your Child Learn</h2>
<p>From music to swimming lessons, ballet to art classes, children today have their schedules packed to the brim with activities parents hope will give them a head start in life. Most parents think they have an idea of how their child learns. They therefore seize every opportunity to maximise their child's learning potential in the way they think is best. Others adopt the &quot;let nature take its course&quot; stance. The fact remains that people learn in different ways and at a different pace. Children are no exception.</p>
<h2>Know Your Child's Style Of Learning</h2>
<p>Some people learn better visually. This means they need to see what is going on in order to learn. For instance, younger kids learn primarily by observing and imitating. Children who respond best in this way need drawings, diagrams and pictures in their learning experiences. <br>
Some children are better learners with auditory tasks that require listening. You may have seen older children who close their eyes in order to concentrate, listen and work out a response.<br>
Tactile learners are children who learn through touch and action. This is most noticeable in very young children who learn about their world by feeling objects and exploring their environment.<br>
Other useful ways of learning include repetition and association. As the term implies, repetition involves the repeated practicing of skills. It is important to bear in mind that there should be some basis of understanding prior to practice. Association is another aid in learning effectively. Children learn by associating one concept with another. For example, a letter of the alphabet with a word like 'A for apple', 'B for ball'.<br>
The above are just some examples of learning styles. In general, using a variety of ways and not just one, such as visual only or repetition alone, makes learning more effective and efficient.</p>
<h2>Know What To Do To Help Your Child Learn</h2>
<p>Although children do learn by exploring or playing on their own, learning can be enhanced through meaningful interaction with another person. When interacting with your child, it is important to take time to observe what your child is interested in, wait to see what he will do and listen to what he is saying or trying to tell you.</p>
<h2>Learn Together With Your Child</h2>
<p>Parents who are busy are less available to tune in to their children's needs. Parents who do too much for their children may also deprive them of opportunities to learn. These children tend to become 'spoon-fed' learners in the process. Many parents take up a teacher's role instead of being a parent. These parents may find their child to be passive, reluctant and possibly bored learner. These children who could have learned more through an enjoyable time of interaction with their parents. A supportive learning environment is provided through a balance of roles and activities. It is important to let your child know you are interested in him. You can tell him new and interesting things and ask questions to keep the interaction going. Take turns to make comments. Explore and experience new situations together. <br>
Soon you find that you are learning more about your child and he is learning more about you. Because each child is unique in his own way as you are. It will take time, effort and patience to work out what is best for both of you. Remember that you can make the difference in helping your child learn!</p>
<h2>Know Your Goals And Expectations</h2>
<p>Opportunities can be lost with unclear goals and unrealistic expectations. For some parents, learning equal good school grades. Others take pride in their preschoolers who can recite nursery rhymes or the alphabet, yet it remains uncertain whether the child has any understanding of what he is saying.<br>
Parents need to know what learning constitutes and realise that it means much more than academic performance outcomes. Social learning for example, is where a child learns to observe rules and develop good relationships in life. A child who learns politeness and consideration for others is likely to grow up to be gracious. A child who returns his test papers to have marks deducted for an oversight in his teacher's marking shows not only academic knowledge but also honesty - a virtue. A parent who trains her child to keep his own toys imparts a sense of responsibility. Parents who stop to talk to their children about the different flowers and trees in the park may cultivate an interest in nature. Most importantly, learning is a lifelong process that encompasses many areas that textbooks do not, and cannot, cover.</p>
