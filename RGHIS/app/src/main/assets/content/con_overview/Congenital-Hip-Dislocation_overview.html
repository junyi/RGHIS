            <p><strong>Congenital hip dislocation (CHD)</strong> is better known as <strong>developmental dysplasia of the hip</strong>. CHD is a condition where the head ('ball) of the femur (thigh bone) moves out of the socket of the pelvic bone, called the acetabulum. The head of the femur may lie within the acetabulum but can be moved partially (subluxable) or totally (dislocatable) out of it. It may even lie completely outside the acetabulum and behind the socket, in which case it is dislocated.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes </span></h2>
            <p>A child with CHD usually does not have any symptom at birth. CHD can be detected through newborn screening by a doctor. The doctor will perform certain hip manoeuvres to check if the femoral head moves in and out of the acetabulum. If CHD is suspected from clinical screening, your baby will need to undergo an ultrasound scan of the hips to confirm diagnosis. You may be given an appointment with your doctor and/or bone specialist (called an orthopaedic surgeon) for further treatment.</p>
