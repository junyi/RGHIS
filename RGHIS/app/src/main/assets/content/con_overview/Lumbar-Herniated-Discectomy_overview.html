            <ul>
                <li>Due to natural loss of elasticity and / or injury over the years, the disc degenerates. The degenerated disc may herniate backwards into the spinal canal and press on a spinal nerve root </li>
                <li>Weak spot is directly under the nerve root </li>
                <li>90% occurs in either the L4-5 or L5-S1 region </li>
                <li>Compression of the spinal nerves results in severe radiating pain or numbness or weakness of muscles </li>
                <li>Severe compression can lead to permanent nerve damage </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>L5 nerve impingement from a herniated disc can cause weakness in extension of the big toe and potentially in the ankle (foot drop). Numbness and pain can be felt on top of the foot, and the pain may also radiate into the rear </li>
                <li>S1 nerve impingement from a herniated disc may cause loss of the ankle reflex and/or weakness in ankle push off (e.g. patients cannot do toe rises). Numbness and pain can radiate down to the sole or outside of the foot </li>
            </ul>
