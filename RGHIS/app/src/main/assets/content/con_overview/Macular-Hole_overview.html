<h2>What causes Macular Holes?</h2>
<p>Macular holes usually occur due to stress on the macula. The eye is filled with a clear jelly called the vitreous. When one ages, the vitreous usually becomes more liquefied and may pull on the macula. This may result in a tear of the macula, forming a macular hole. Another cause of macular hole is high myopia, where the elongation of the eyeball puts stress on the macula, causing it to break.</p>
