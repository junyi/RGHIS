<p><span style="line-height:18px;color:#666666">TMJ (temporomandibular joint) surgery is an option for management of Temporoamandibular dysfunction, a group of conditions that cause pain and loss of normal function to the jaw joint. <br>
<br>
Our Oral surgeons in NDCS perform TMJ (temporomandibular joint) surgery of varying complexity.
<ul>
    <li>simple washing of the joint (arthrocentesis) </li>
    <li>inserting a scope (arthroscopy) through the incision to examine and treat the joint </li>
    <li>open joint surgery </li>
</ul>
You may be a candidate for joint surgery if
<ul>
    <li>there is disease in your joint </li>
    <li>there is degenerative changes in your joint </li>
    <li>you do not respond to non surgical management </li>
</ul>
