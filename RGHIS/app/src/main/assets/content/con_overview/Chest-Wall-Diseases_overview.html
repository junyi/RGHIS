            <p>The chest wall which includes the rib cage, intercostals muscles and adjacent muscles or the underlying lung, may be involved by tumours or serious infections. Many of these are amenable to surgical resection and reconstruction and are mostly curative if dealt with expediently. Aggressive resection and adequate coverage post resection is highly important to regain the shape of the chest both in terms of cosmesis and chest wall function.<br>

            Pectus excavatum (PE) or carinatum (PC) are two forms of deformity of the front of the chest. PE is where there is a deep cavity in the front of the chest and PC refers to a protrusion, also called 'pigeon chest. These deformities rarely result in decreased heart or lung function. Although more common in children, some may develop negative self-esteem from the deformity as they approach their teens. Repair of the deformities may be done minimally invasively or by an open method at NHCS.</p>
