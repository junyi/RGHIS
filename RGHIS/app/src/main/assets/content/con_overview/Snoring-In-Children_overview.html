            <p>Snoring may be a symptom of a spectrum of problems, including sleep disorders such as Obstructive Sleep Apnoea  a potentially serious disorder associated with snoring, in which breathing is interrupted during sleep. Studies have shown that approximately 24% of the local population are loud habitual snorers.</p>

            Causes</span></h2>
            <p>The sound of snoring is caused by the vibration or flapping of the tissues lining the upper air passages. Snoring in most people is due to multiple factors, each playing some part in the snoring process. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Large tonsils </li>
                <li>Relaxation of muscles causes the walls of the upper airway to fall together, causing them to vibrate. </li>
                <li>Swelling of the tissue in the walls (e.g. from anatomical or injury reasons) causes narrowing of the airway, and results in snoring. </li>
                <li>The tongue may fall back into the throat when sleeping on the back and contribute to the snoring. </li>
                <li>Nasal blockage such as nasal allergy or deformities of the nasal septum (the cartilage partition between the two sides of the nose) can cause poor nasal airflow and set the soft tissues of the palate and throat vibrating. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Large tonsils are the most common cause of snoring and sleep apnoea in infants and children. <br>
            <br>
            Other factors which can influence snoring are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Obesity </li>
                <li>Congestion of the throat due to refl ux of stomach acid (heartburn). </li>
            </ul></div>
