<h2>Jaundice</h2>
<h2>What Is Jaundice?</h2>
<p>Jaundice is the yellow colour seen in the skin of many newborns and happens when a chemical called bilirubin builds up in baby's blood. It can occur in babies of any race.</p>

<h2>Why Does My Baby Have Jaundice?</h2>
<p>Bilirubin in the blood is normally removed by the liver. Before birth, the mother's liver does this for the baby.</p>
<p>Jaundice is common in newborns because their immature livers require a few days to develop before it can eliminate the bilirubin efficiently.</p>
<h2>Can Jaundice Harm My Baby?</h2>
<p>Most infants have mild jaundice that is harmless. However, in some infants, the bilirubin level can be very high and this may cause brain damage.</p>
<p>Hence, newborns should be checked carefully for jaundice and treatment should be administered to prevent a high level of bilirubin.</p>
