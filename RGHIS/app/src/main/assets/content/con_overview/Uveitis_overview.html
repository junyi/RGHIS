            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes </span></h2>
            <p>Sandwiched between the retina and sclera, the uvea contains many blood vessels that carry blood to the eye. Therefore, inflammation of the uvea can affect vision. In most instances, however, the cause of uveitis is unknown.</p>
            <p>The <strong>types of uveitis</strong> include: Iritis, intermediate uveitis and retinitis or choroiditis.</p>
            <p><strong>Iritis</strong><br>
            This condition occurs when the uvea near the front of the eye in the iris is inflamed. Iritis can come on suddenly and may last six to eight weeks. Patients will have eyes that are red and painful. </p>
            <p><strong>Intermediate uveitis<br>
            </strong>This condition occurs when the vitreous gel and peripheral retina are the predominant site of inflammation. It can also happen suddenly and may last for several months. Patients will experience floaters and blurred vision.</p>
            <p><strong>Retinitis or choroiditis</strong><br>
            This condition occurs when the retina or vascular layer next to the retina (choroid) is inflamed. This condition is slower to begin and may last longer. If it affects the retinal vessels, it is called retinal vasculitis.</p>
