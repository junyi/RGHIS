<p><span style="color:#666666;line-height:18px">Before placing braces on your teeth, you will need a check-up for decay or gum problems. Do visit your dentist or the School Dental Clinic regularly, even when you are on braces.<br>

<br>
<strong>Fixed braces</strong> consist of brackets and bands bonded or cemented to your teeth (to get a hold of them), and very thin metal wires that gently push your teeth into their right positions. The wire is tied into the brackets with a steel ligature or a coloured plastic ring. Some brackets have clips to hold the wires and no ties are needed. Brackets can be made of metal or tooth-coloured ceramic or plastic. Ordinary fixed braces are bonded to the front of your teeth. There are also braces that can be bonded on the back of your teeth (lingual braces).<br>
<br>
<strong>Removable braces</strong> are sometimes used when you are still growing or if you still have baby teeth left. Functional removable braces are used to change jaw growth to normalise your bite.<br>

<br>
<span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px"><strong>First Visit:</strong></span><br>
X-rays, photos and impressions for plaster study models of your teeth are done. Your orthodontist will plan your treatment using these records. Very often, permanent teeth are removed when they are crowded and there is not enough space in the jaws for all of them. The extractions are done just before or just after the fitting of your braces.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px"><strong>Second Visit:</strong></span><br>
Your orthodontist will explain the treatment plan and the braces suitable for your condition. Before braces are fitted, separators (small plastic &quot;doughnuts&quot;) are placed between your molars for a week to create spaces for the molar bands.<br>
<br>
<strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Third and Fourth Visits:</span></strong><br>
Bands are cemented and brackets are bonded to the front of your teeth.<br>
<br>
<strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Subsequent Visits:</span></strong><br>
Every 4 to 8 weeks, adjustments are made to the braces by way of wire-changers, adding springs, elastics or other accessories.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong><br>
Accessories are necessary to make your braces work. Elastics are often used to get your upper and lower teeth to bite together properly. Facemask, headgear or biteplate are sometimes used with fixed braces. It is very important to use all accessories exactly as you have been told. Otherwise, progress of the treatment might stop or even reverse.<br>
<br>
</div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Introduction><strong><span style="color:#00cccc">When Treatment is Completed</span></strong><br>
Your fixed braces will be removed at a deband appointment, followed by removal of cement and polishing of your teeth. Moulds of your teeth in their new positions are taken to make retainers. After your braces are removed, you will need retainers to hold your teeth in their new positions for the <span style="text-decoration:underline">next few years</span>. Do read the brochure &quot;After Braces Always Retainers&quot;.<br>
<br>
</div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Introduction><strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">How Long Does Treatment Take?</span></strong><br>
The normal period of treatment with fixed braces is 2 to 3 years. You will need to make time every 4 to 8 weeks for visit your orthodontist regularly of you wish your treatment to finish well and on time.<br>
<br>
</div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Introduction><strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">How Will Braces Affect My Daily Life?</span></strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Speech:</strong><br>
With regular fixed braces, speech is normally not affected at all. However, if your condition requires a palatal expander appliance to be fitted at the roof of your mouth, this may interfere with your speech. If you have lingual braces, you will take some time to learn to speak properly with the braces.<br>
<br>
<strong>Playing musical instruments:</strong><br>
If you play a musical instrument with a mouthpiece, it will take you 1 to 2 weeks to become as skilful as before.<br>
<br>
</div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Introduction><strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Brushing With Braces</span></strong><br>
With braces on, your teeth are more difficult to clean. Do not leave food on your braces. Brushing your teeth properly after every snack and meal will reduce the risk of decay and gum disease. In addition, 5 minutes of brushing are needed every morning and night. Have your toothbrush available to brush after meals as well as at your orthodontic visits. You can use disclosing solution to check if your teeth are clean. You will need to replace your toothbrush more often as it will wear out faster.<br>
<br>
</div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Introduction><strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Eating and Diet Restrictions</span></strong><br>
Eating hard food or biting on large pieces of food may dislodge the brackets or bands and damage the wires. Avoid eating nuts and biting on nails or pencils. Do cut hard fruits into small and thin pieces before eating them. Avoid food and drinks with high sugar content such as sweets and soft drinks.<br><br>
