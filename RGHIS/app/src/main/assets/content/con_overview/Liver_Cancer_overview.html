<p class="p1"><b>What is Liver Cancer?<br>
</b><br>
The liver is one of the major organs of the body, and is vital to live (hence the name live-r). It is involved in many processes of the body, such as manufacturing various essential proteins, processing and storing nutrients, destroying toxins and poisons among others. The liver is made up of many different cell types, but the two main ones are liver cells (hepatocytes) and cells lining the bile ducts (cholangiocytes). <br>
</p>
<p class="p1">Like any other part of the body, the cells in the liver can undergo changes to form cancer. Liver cells that become cancerous form liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC). Cancerous cells that start from other parts of the body and spread to the liver, for example, colon cancer that has spread, does not constitute liver cancer in the strictest sense. These are known as secondary liver tumours or metastatic cancers to the liver.<br>
<br>
<b>How common is Liver Cancer?</b><br>
<br>
Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. In Singapore, it is the fourth most common cancer among men. It affects about 22 individuals in every 100,000 people a year.</p>
<p class="p2">Liver cancer is mainly an Asian disease, and is common in South-East Asia, China, Japan and Korea. It is also common in parts of Africa and the Mediterranean (especially Italy).</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Age of Onset</b><br>
<br>
Liver cancer occurs in persons in the older age group, from 40 to 50 years old. It can affect a younger individual who has contracted chronic hepatitis B or C from birth or in those with certain congenital conditions.</p>

Causes and Risks</b></h2>
<p class="p1">The three main causative factors for liver cancer are hepatitis B carrier status, hepatitis C infection and alcoholic liver disease. Other rare causes include poisons (aflatoxin) from fungus growing in badly preserved food (especially grains), congenital conditions (alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency), and any cause of liver hardening or cirrhosis (e.g. haemachromatosis).<br>
<br>
The risk of an individual with hepatitis B or C of getting liver cancer is 100 times more as compared to an individual without hepatitis B or C. The pattern of liver cancer worldwide follows closely with the pattern of hepatitis B and C infections. In countries where immunization for hepatitis B is available, the number of liver cancers seen per year has also fallen and has also seen a fall in the number of hepatitis B cases. Hepatitis B can be transmitted from an infected mother to her baby during pregnancy. In the adult setting, hepatitis B and C can be transmitted by contact with infected body fluids, for example saliva, blood, sperm and other secretions. Blood transfusion is no longer a risk factor because of adequate screening methods in Singapore.<br>
<br>
Alcohol is the main cause of liver cancer in the Western population. The liver is damaged by repeated and excessive alcohol abuse leading to liver hardening (cirrhosis) and liver cancer.</p>
