<h2>Childhood Head Injury Prevention - Tips For Caregivers:</h2>
<p><strong>Nothing</strong> can replace close adult caregiver supervision in childhood injury prevention.</p>
<p>Children are not able to identify the potential injury hazards in their environment and they need your care and protection. </p>
<h3>Infants and toddlers:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Do not leave your baby unattended, even for a few seconds, on an adult bed or baby cot without proper barriers. </li>
    <li>Do not use the sarong cradle. Head injuries, skull fractures and even deaths have occurred when infants fall off the sarong or when the springs or attachments of the cradle breaks. </li>
    <li>Do not use a baby walker. They can topple over and many falls causing head injuries have been documented locally and overseas. Some cases of deaths as a result of these injuries have been reported. </li>
    <li>Do not shake violently even when your may feel frustrated or angry. This can cause severe and fatal internal head bleeding. </li>
    <li>Ensure that the high chair your child uses is of a sturdy design and use the appropriate restraints when your child is seated in it. </li>
    <li class=last>Use an age-appropriate car seat for your child. </li>
</ol>
<h3>School-going children:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Supervise children closely in playgrounds. Prevent them from climbing onto unstable and high structures. Avoid playgrounds that are poorly maintained or have unsafe designs (e.g. hard flooring, rusted or broken metal parts). </li>
    <li>Ensure that a properly fitted protective helmet is used for activities like cycling, skating, skateboarding, roller blading, or during the use of the skate scooter. </li>
    <li>Teach your child road safety habits. Do not allow your child to play or go on the roads unsupervised. </li>
    <li>Ensure that your child puts on age-appropriate seat belts or booster seat restraints while in a vehicle. </li>
    <li class=last>Teach your child sports and recreational safety rules. </li>
</ul>
