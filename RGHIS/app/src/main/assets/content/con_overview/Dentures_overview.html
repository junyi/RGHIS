<p><span style="color:#666666;line-height:18px">A denture is a removable prosthesis used to replace missing teeth. Commonly referred to as &quot;false teeth&quot;, it is usually made of acrylic or a combination of acrylic and metal. A partial denture is fitted to replace some missing teeth whilst a complete denture is indicated when all natural teeth are missing. A good set of dentures helps you to eat, speak, function and often makes the person look better.

Depending on the complexity of each case, the duration of the treatment will take about 2 to 6 visits. After the initial visit of examination and diagnosis, the subsequent visits will include taking impressions of the mouth, bite registration, try-in of the denture, issue and review.<br>

New dentures always feel strange when first placed in the mouth. Several days or weeks will be required before you get accustomed to them. Adaptation varies with different people and often, time and experience are essential before dentures can be worn comfortably and function effectively.<br>
<br>
</div><font face='Arial' size='2'><font face='Arial' size='4'><div id=Introduction>
<span style="color:#00cccc"><strong>Here are some useful suggestions to help you adapt to the new dentures.</strong></span><br>
<strong>Eating</strong> - Eating will take a little practice. Start with soft foods and foods cut into small pieces will help. Chew slowly using both sides of the mouth simultaneously to prevent dentures from tipping. Once you become accustomed to chewing, include other foods until you return to your normal diet.<br>
<br>
<strong>Increased salivary flow</strong> - You may experience an increase in salivary flow when the dentures are first inserted. This is a natural response of the salivary glands which will return to normal after a few weeks. You can improve the situation by swallowing more often.<br>
<br>
<strong>Speech</strong> - New dentures may alter your speech initially. Pronouncing certain words may require practice. Reading out loud and repeating troublesome words will speed up the adaptation process. This problem rarely persists beyond two weeks.<br>
<br>
<strong>Sore spots</strong> - Minor irritation caused by surface irregularities or pressure spots on the denture-bearing areas are quite common. Your dentist will relieve the discomfort by adjusting the denture surface. Stop wearing the denture if great pain develops. Consult your dentist immediately.<br>

<span style="color:#00cccc"><strong>How do you take care of your dentures?</strong></span><br>
Like natural teeth, dentures can accumulate plaque and food debris, particularly in those areas where the denture is in contact with the remaining teeth and gum. In addition to the usual oral hygiene measures like tooth brushing, dentures should be cleaned regularly. Poor denture hygiene results in stains on the denture and a bad odour. <br>
<br>
If possible, dentures should be removed and cleaned after every meal. When cleaning, remember the following:
<ul>
    <li>Use a soft handbrush or a special denture brush </li>
    <li>Avoid very hot water as it may distort the denture </li>
    <li>Use mild detergent to clean. Avoid using abrasive cleaners that can roughen the polished surface of the denture. Do not use bleach as this may whiten the pink acrylic </li>
    <li>Hold the denture firmly while cleaning. Accidental droppage may result in chipped or broken dentures. Always wash your denture over a basin of water </li>
    <li>Soak the dentures in denture cleanser once a week to remove stains and always rinse them thoroughly before using the dentures again. When you are not wearing the dentures, store them in water. Dentures may lose their shape if left to dry out. </li>
</ul>

<span style="color:#00cccc"><strong>For how long should dentures be worn?</strong></span><br>
During the first few days, you are advised to wear them most of the time except when sleeping. Always remove the dentures before going to bed. This will allow your gum tissues to rest and promote oral health. Gentle massaging of the gums with a soft toothbrush is encouraged. Remember to soak the dentures in water to prevent them from drying out.<br>
