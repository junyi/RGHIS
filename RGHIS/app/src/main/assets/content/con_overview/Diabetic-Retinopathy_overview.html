<h1 class=sectionbanner>DIABETIC RETINOPATHY</h2>
<p><em>Diabetes is a condition where the body does not produce enough insulin to convert sugar to energy, leading to a build up of sugar in the blood. This leads to a number of problems, including diabetic retinopathy -- which is one of the leading causes of adult blindness in Singapore</em></p>
<h2>What is Diabetic Retinopathy?</h2>
<p>Diabetic retinopathy is a disorder of the blood vessels in the  of patients with diabetes mellitus. It is the leading cause of new blindness in working adults in developed countries, including Singapore. </p>

<h2>What causes Diabetic Retinopathy?</h2>
<p>Diabetic retinopathy first manifests itself slowly over the years as background retinopathy, which is the early stage of diabetic retinopathy. At this early stage, tiny blood spots or fatty deposits appear on the retina.</p>
<p>Proliferative retinopathy develops from background retinopathy and is responsible for most of the visual loss in diabetics. In this condition, new blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina and optic nerve. These immature blood vessels tend to rupture and bleed into the cavity of the eye. Scar tissue can also form from the ruptured blood vessels and can contract and pull on the retina, causing  and vision loss. In some cases, new vessels can grow on the iris and cause a form of , which itself can lead to blindness.</p>

<h2>What puts me at risk of Diabetic Retinopathy?</h2>
<p>Your risk of diabetic retinopathy increases with the duration of diabetes. About 60% of patients with diabetes for 15 years or more will have some blood vessel damage in their eyes. Some of these patients are at risk of developing blindness.<br>

<h2>What can I do to prevent Diabetic Retinopathy?</h2>
<p>If you are diabetic, you must control your blood sugar level and blood pressure to reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy. Unfortunately, good glucose control does not wholly eliminate the risk of diabetic retinopathy.</p>
