            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview</span></h2>
            <p>An estimated three to 10 percent of the global population has <strong>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).</strong> This disorder is more common in boys than girls. Every three boys to one girl are diagnosed with ADHD. Children with ADHD start to face problems in school and at home before they turn seven years old. </p>
            <p>ADHD is diagnosed after the child has shown signs of inattention and/or hyperactivity on a regular basis for over six months in school and at home. </p>
            <p>A childs normal attention span is believed to develop in three stages. In the first stage, a childs attention is focused solely on one object for a long time and he tunes out all other stimuli. If a child gets stuck at this stage and doesnt move on, he could have autism.</p>
            <p>In the second stage, the child develops a wide but rapidly changing attention span. A child who is stuck at this stage of attention span is diagnosed as having an attention deficit disorder.</p>
            <p>Finally, the child develops selective attention where he is able to shift focus at will, from being inclusive to being exclusive. This is a mature pattern of attention and concentration that is required for a child to succeed in a classroom setting.</p>
            <p>Some people with ADHD do become successful later in life. However, others continue to have strong symptoms as adults. Some are not able to adapt to society on their own. These people often drop out of school and social life. It is for this last reason that children who have signs of ADHD should receive all the help to spare them frustration and anguish later on in life.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes </span></h2>
            <p>ADHD is believed to be caused by a neurological imbalance within the brain, affecting areas associated with focusing, planning and organisation. The condition is either hereditary or acquired. </p>
            <p>Like many other disorders, a child may have the symptoms while his parents do not. But usually there will be aunts, uncles, grandparents or cousins with the disorder. </p>
            <p>Possible causes include the use of drugs, hypertension and infections during the pregnancy, overexposure to radiation and a premature or complicated childbirth. </p>
            <p>A child may acquire ADHD as a result of brain infections, fits, head injury and lead poisoning. </p>
            <p>Eating too many sweets does not cause ADHD although it may make the symptoms worse for some children who already have the condition.</p>
