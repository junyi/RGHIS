<h2>Bronchiolitis</h2>
<p>Bronchiolitis is a very common infection in young children - occurring mainly in infants and children less than 2 years old. It is caused by viruses that infect the small breathing airways.</p>
<p>The illness begins as a cold, leading to cough and breathlessness. This may interfere with feeding and sleep.</p>
<p>Babies with bronchiolitis are usually sick for 3 - 5 days, and then gradually recover over the next 2 - 3 days. The cough itself, however, may persist for 2 - 3 weeks.</p>
