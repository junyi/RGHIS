            <p><strong>What is Testicular Cancer?<br>
            </strong><br>
            The testes comprise primitive cells that mature to become cells that make spermatozoa or sperm that are important in sexual reproduction. There are also supporting cells that make enzymes and other fluid that enable the sperm to function properly. These primitive cells may become cancerous. These tumours are called testicular germ cell cancers.</p>
            <p><strong>How common is Testicular Cancer?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Testicular cancer represents about only 1-2 % of all cancers in males, but is one of the most common cancers in young men. </p>
            <p><strong>Age of Onset</strong><br>
            <br>
            It occurs predominantly in males aged 20 - 40 years.</p>

            Causes and Risks</span></h2>
            <p>Males who have a history of undescended testes (testes that did not descend to lie in the scrotum during development) have a much higher chance of developing testicular cancer. Other risk factors include history of testicular cancer in the other testis and family history of testicular cancer.</p>
