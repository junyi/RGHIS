            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Overview </span></h2>
            <p>Gallstone disease is a result of stone formation in the gallbladder. Gallstones are of two main types: cholesterol and pigment. In Asians, brown pigment stones may form within the liver as well.</p>
            <p>Gallstones can be painless and cause no health problems (i.e. asymptomatic). The chance of complications arising from asymptomatic stones is one to two per cent each year. Complications like cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice, cholangitis or pancreatitis may arise.</p>

            <h2><span style="color:#ff6600">Causes and Risks</span></h2>
            <p><strong><span style="color:#ff6600"></span></strong></p>
            <p>Gallstones develop as a result of an imbalance in the components of bile. In a normal person, cholesterol in the bile is prevented from forming stones by bile acids and proteins secreted in the bile.</p>
            <p>A diet rich in cholesterol, female gender, obesity, multiparity, genetic factors, old age, total parenteral nutrition, poor contraction of the gallbladder and hemolytic anemias can predispose patients to gallstone formation by causing an upset in the balance. Cholesterol crystals form and these enlarge to become &quot;sludge &quot; and later stones.</p>
