            <p>This procedure treats the condition Thyrotoxicosis. </p>
            <p>The thyroid gland requires iodine to manufacture thyroid hormone. Iodine comes from the food that we take and some foods are especially rich in iodine e.g. seafood. </p>
            <p>Thyrotoxicosis is a condition where the thyroid gland is overly active. This condition can be treated by giving radioactive iodine by mouth. The radio-iodine is processed by the thyroid in the same manner as the iodine from food. The radiation given off by the radio-iodine reduces the function of the thyroid cells and inhibits their ability to grow, which is the desired medical effect. The amount of radio-iodine given is dependent on the patient's medical condition. The dose is decided by the Nuclear Medicine physician after he has conducted a series of tests on the patient. The dosage may not be the same for every patient. </p>
            <p>In some cases, a second dose of iodine might be required if the first dose is not effective.</p>
