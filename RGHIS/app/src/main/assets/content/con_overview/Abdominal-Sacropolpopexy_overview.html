<h2>Abdominal Sacropolpopexy</h2>
<h2>What Is Sacrocolpopexy?</h2>
<p>It is an operation performed from the abdomen to support the vagina to the ligament on the spine (after previous or concurrent surgery to remove the womb) by using a synthetic mesh.</p>
<h2>Why Is It Performed?</h2>
<p>It is performed to treat severe protrusion of the vagina after removal of the womb.</p>
<p>The protrusion usually bothers you because of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An uncomfortable lump </li>
    <li>Urinary difficulties (e.g. incomplete emptying of the bladder) </li>
    <li>Bowel difficulties (e.g. constipation, incomplete emptying of bowels) </li>
    <li>Pain </li>
    <li>Infection </li>
    <li class=last>Bleeding </li>
</ul>
<p>The objective of the operation is to relieve your symptoms, restore vaginal anatomy (as much as possible) and sexual function.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Bleeding </li>
    <li>Infection </li>
    <li>Injury to surrounding organs (e.g. nerve or blood vessels, ureter, bladder &amp; intestines) </li>
    <li>Formation of blood clot in the legs or lungs </li>
    <li>Recurrence of vaginal prolapse </li>
    <li>Slow return of bowel or bladder function </li>
    <li class=last>Erosion of synthetic material through vaginal mucosa </li>
</ul>
