            <p>Lung transplantation is an effective treatment for patients with end-stage lung disease   a condition where the lungs are so diseased that they can no longer perform their normal function to obtain sufficient oxygen for the body. The National Heart Centre Singapore (NHCS) set up the lung transplant programme in 2000. To date, about 10 lung transplants have been carried out, giving recipients a new lease of life. NHCS is the only healthcare institution in Singapore that carries out lung transplantations. </p>
