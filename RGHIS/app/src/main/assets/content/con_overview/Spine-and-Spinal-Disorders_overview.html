            <p>The spinal column is responsible for transmission of body weight from the head to the pelvis and protection of the spinal cord. The spinal column consists of bony vertebral bodies connected together by cartilage-like structures (discs) and ligaments (Figure 1). The spine is a mobile structure and its mobility depends on integrity of these structures. Variety of diseases can affect the spine and results in functional failure producing variety of symptoms and signs. <br>

            <p><strong>Degenerative Disease of the Spine (Spondylosis)<br>
            </strong><br>
            The spine is subjected to wear and tear like all joints in the body, with resultant changes in the structure. Degeneration of the disc may cause it to bulge and compress spinal cord or nerves. This will produce pain in the neck, back, arm or leg, even numbness or weakness. See Figures 2 and 3. These degenerative disorders are diagnosed through physical examination and confirmed by imaging studies. See Figure 4 (MRI). Treatment in most cases consists of conservative methods such as rest, medications and physiotherapy. Intervention is indicated for severe symptoms or failure to respond to therapy. One option is nerve or facet block techniques (with injection of steroids or radiofrequency lesions) which will help reduce or eliminate the pain. The final option is surgical treatment.</p>
