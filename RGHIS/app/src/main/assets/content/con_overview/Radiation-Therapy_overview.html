<h2>Radiation Therapy</h2>
<h2>What Is Radiation Therapy?</h2>
<p>Radiation is the use of high energy X-rays to treat malignant tumors and some benign conditions. It had been in use for medical treatment for more than 100 years and ongoing innovations are increasing its effectiveness.</p>
<p>The external beam treatment is not painful, and there is no discomfort during the treatment. You will not become &quot;radioactive&quot; and hence will not pose any health hazard to your family members or friends.</p>
<h2>What To Expect?</h2>
<p>You will be seen by your doctor who will determine your treatment plan. An appointment will be made for treatment simulation planning.</p>
<h2>What Is Simulation Planning?</h2>
<p>This is a procedure to determine the area of treatment for the purpose of planning your radiation fields. The procedure may take 15 minutes.</p>
<ul>
    <li>You will be asked to lie on the X-ray table for the procedure. </li>
    <li>A piece of tampon soaked with contrast medium will be inserted into your vagina for this examination, this is usually painless. </li>
    <li>X-rays will be taken and various marking may be drawn on your skin. Permanent markings or tattoos will also be made. This is to allow alignment during set-up. </li>
    <li>DO NOT wash away the markings. </li>
    <li>DO NOT use soap on the area when you bathe until you have completed your course of radiotherapy. </li>
</ul>
