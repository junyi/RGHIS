                        <p>A <strong>Sudden Cardiac Death</strong> (SCD) attack is when there is an abrupt loss of heart function and can be due to a variety of heart conditions. However, the most common cause of SCD is a sudden onset of abnormal heart rhythm. This is usually due to a fast but chaotic heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation (VF) or tachycardia (VT). Occasionally SCD can be due to very slow heart rhythm due to abnormality of the heart pacemaker cells or during a heart attack. It is estimated that 1000 Singaporeans die from SCD every year, about half of whom are below 60 years old. </p>
