<p><span style="color:#666666;line-height:18px">Caries is a loss of tooth structure (demineralization) by organic acids produced by bacteria in dental plaque. When you develop a cavity (caries) the dentist will remove decayed tooth structure and prepare the tooth to receive a filling. A filling is an inert material which will replace the tooth structure lost through decay.<br>

<strong><span style="color:#00cccc;line-height:18px">Causes</span></strong><br>
Caries is caused by a combination of factors which involve:
<ul>
    <li>Saliva </li>
    <li>Plaque </li>
    <li>Diet </li>
    <li>Tooth factors </li>
</ul>
Your tooth is made up of calcium and phosphate ions. There is a dynamic exchange of these ions between your tooth and its surrounding. When any of the above factors are modified to favour the lost calcium and phosphate from your tooth, you will, over time, develop a cavity. <br>
