            <p><strong>What are thyroid?<br>
            </strong><br>
            The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located just below your Adams apple, with its wings on either side of your windpipe. It produces thyroid hormone, which controls your metabolic rate.</p>

            Causes </span></h2>
            <p>The exact cause of thyroid nodules is not known, but the following factors may be involved:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A lack of iodine in your diet </li>
                <li>A thyroid condition such as goitre or hypothyroidism, in particular Hashimotos thyroiditis </li>
                <li>Exposure to radiation treatments </li>
                <li>A history of thyroid nodules in your family </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Is your neck lump a thyroid nodule?</strong><br>
            <br>
            If you have a lump in the middle of your neck (below your Adams apple) or just off the center, which moves with swallowing, it is probably a thyroid nodule. Your doctor will be able to confirm this finding. The lump you feel may be either a solitary nodule or a dominant nodule in a background of multiple nodules, or even a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland.</p>
