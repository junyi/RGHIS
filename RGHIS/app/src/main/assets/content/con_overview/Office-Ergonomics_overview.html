            <p>At the end of the workday, you uncurl yourself from your seat in front of your computer screen and you find your shoulder and back hurts, and there is a nagging pain in your hands. This could be the result of poor ergonomics and the way you work. </p>
            <p>Ergonomics is the science of fitting the job to the worker. When there is a mismatch between the physical requirements of the job and the physical capacity of the worker, Occupational Overuse Syndrome (OOS) can result. Occupational Overuse Syndrome, also known as Repetitive Stress Injury (RSI), is a collective term for a range of conditions characterised by discomfort or persistent pain in muscles, tendons, and other soft tissues. Some common conditions are <strong>backaches</strong>, stiff <strong>necks and shoulders</strong> and .<br>
            <br>
            Ergonomics is a way to solve a host of physical problems brought about by over-exertion or repetitive stress</p>

            <p><strong><em>Who are at risk of developing Occupational Overuse Syndrome (OOS)?</em></strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>People who must repeat the same motion throughout their workday </li>
                <li>People who must do their work in an awkward position </li>
                <li>People who must use a great deal of force to perform their jobs </li>
                <li>People who must repeatedly lift heavy objects </li>
                <li>Office workers who spend long hours working on the computers are also at <br>
                risk of developing OOS if they do not observe good ergonomics </li>
